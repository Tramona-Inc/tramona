You’ll find that comfort and privacy abound in this private home, which offers luxurious amenities and that extra special touch you won’t find at other rentals in the area.\n\nThe central location puts you close to all of the fun, excitement, and history found in the city, while providing you with plenty of space for relaxation. You’ll be located in a residential neighborhood that showcases the diversity that Washington D.C has become known for. Enjoy hanging out in the backyard after a long day of sightseeing, put your favorite movie on the flat-panel Roku TV, or order some take-out with the Amazon Echo while listening to your favorite music.  The living area is also business-ready with a desk available should you need to get some work done during your stay.\n\nJust off the kitchen is a dining area with seating for four. Enjoy a quick breakfast or an espresso before visiting DC’s landmarks, or enjoy a dinner prepared in the fully-stocked kitchen. The updated kitchen includes quartz countertops, stainless-steel appliances, including dishwasher and gas range, and is fully stocked with essentials including cookware, dishware, and utensils. There is a beautiful fenced backyard for getting some fresh air, where you'll also find a full-size grill and gas fire-pit for enjoying this outdoor space.  There you can also feel free to pick whatever fresh herbs, fruits or vegetables you might find ready to harvest!\n\nYour friends and family will rest in comfort in the 3 bedrooms. The master bedroom is fitted with a queen bed, a small walk-in closet, and an en suite bathroom. The second  bedroom has a full bed for two additional guests.  The third room maximizes space with a queen Murphy bed, freeing up this room for other activities and easy access to the balcony when the bed isn’t in use. The small balcony off of the third bedroom can be used as an alternative workspace, or simply another place for you to spread out and take in some fresh air. A second full bathroom is available between the bedrooms and includes a tub.  All of the beds are fitted with sheets and thick, plush comforters to provide peaceful rest for everyone.  There is also a pack-n-play available (i.e. portable crib) with its own mattress and sheets available for guests to use, and then if need be the Murphy bedroom can easily be set up for use as a nursery for guests with infants.\n\nFor your convenience, high-speed Wi-Fi is available free-of-charge so you can connect with your friends and family at home, or keep up with your work emails.

For your convenience, we installed a keypad entry to the home, allowing you go about your day without having to track a key. The code is changed after check-out.Neighborhoodairbnb.com/locations/washington-dc/capitol-hill\n\nHill East is a great residential neighborhood adjacent to Capitol Hill. It is primarily residential, but just far enough from downtown that there is space for plenty of services, including full-sized supermarkets, parks, and playgrounds. It is very walkable and sufficiently close to everything that you won’t feel too far out in the suburbs. Eastern Market and Lincoln Park are conveniently located for your children to play, or to get some people-watching in.  \n\nWhile there are some friendly neighborhood bars and restaurants in Hill East, you’ll find many more options right in Capitol Hill on 8th Street, or the nearby lively H Street Corridor. You can quickly get to those parts of town if you want; it is a longish walk, or you can simply take the Metro that is only two blocks away. Parking is usually easy to come by. If you happen to be a soccer fan, DC United's RFK stadium is less than a 10-minute walk away for getting out to a game while you're in town.  If you're looking for my personal recommendations of places to go or things to see, please ask me!\n \nPerhaps the biggest advantage of Hill East (sometimes also called Barney Circle) is the strong sense of community. It is the sort of place where residents know each other by name, and help one another with yard work.\n\nFind out more about what's nearby here:  airbnb.com/locations/washington-dc/capitol-hillOther things to notePaper products such as paper towels and toilet paper will be refreshed and provided to you prior to your arrival, but you will be responsible for replenishing should you run out during your stay and need more.Getting AroundStadium-Armory METRO stop is two blocks away at 19th St and A St SE and has Orange, Blue, & Silver line access, multiple bus stops, as well as a bikeshare station. \n\nThe house is only a 20-minute drive from Reagan National Airport or a 10-minute drive from Union Station.",

    "description": "♢ Only 3 blocks! to the nearest Metro subway station at Tenleytown-AU on the Red Line\n♢ Super convenient to American University (AU)\n♢ 10-minutes by car to downtown Washington DC\n♢ Fully fitted rooftop deck for your enjoyment\n♢ Nursery accommodates even the tiniest of our guests :)\n♢ Smart HDTV w cable + Netflix in living room\n♢ FREE 105MBPS High-speed Wi-Fi\n♢ Amazon's Alexa at your service w/in-house Echo\n♢ FREE Parking in driveway\n♢ Kid- & family-friendly rentalThe SpaceWelcome to our home in DC! \n\nThis house on Albemarle St Northwest was constructed in 1949 on what at the time was undeveloped land in the DC commuter suburb of Tenleytown. It was sold to its first owner the same year for the bargain price of $6000.\n\nChristina and I took one look at this house and fell in love. 53 years after its first purchase, in the summer of 2012 we became the 2nd owners (we unfortunately had to pay a bit more than $6k). The house was in such bad shape it scared most everyone away! I didn’t know this at the time, but my bride likes her houses the same as her men - rough-around-the-edges but charming with lots of potential. \n\nWe spent the next 4 years making this place our own. Fast forward to today - this little house has seen 3 engagements (our own and 2 of our best friends’), multiple renovations, a new baby, and too many all-day BBQs to remember. Work took both of us away in 2016, but we still try to get back as much as we can to unwind.\n\nDC is phenomenal city! There’s lots of fun to be had here - very accessible by foot, great sites, lots of history, tons of excellent food and even a bit of charm if you look in the right places! We’re glad you’re here and hope you love the house and the city as much as we do.\n\nNestled in upper Northwest DC, Tenleytown is the District’s second oldest community. A blend of quiet neighborhood and urban center, Tenleytown is a wonderful area to explore.\n\nWe recommend the following:\n\n-Coffee \n  • Bread Furst\n  • Bourbon Coffee\n\n-Lunch\n  • Tons of restaurants on Wisconsin St (turn left on Albemarle, walk straight for 3 blocks, turn right on Wisconsin)\n  • Be sure to check out \"Little Red Fox\" on Connecticut. Awesome sandwiches and crazy good desserts\n\n-Dinner\n   • Le Chat Noir\n   • Sfoglina\n\n-Hidden park\n  • Wonderful little hidden park by the Austrian Embassy at 36 and Yuma. 10 minutes away - Take an evening stroll.Guest AccessThere is a Roku on the main floor.  The Roku controller will power on both the TV and the Roku.  Please remember to sign out of all streaming services before you leave!\n\nSecret Basement room: Sony TV remote turns on TV. Press 'Home' on remote to get the Android TV menu. All apps accessible from there.NeighborhoodNestled in-between the DC wards of Van Ness and Tenleytown, this area has a small-town feel with all the amenities of the city.  Perched on the city’s highest point, Tenleytown in Northwest Washington is the place to find almost anything you want. And if you can’t find what you’re looking for, it’s probably just a short walk or Metro ride away.\n\nWide sidewalks along Tenleytown’s sloping, tree-lined residential streets make getting around the neighborhood a breeze, whether it’s a morning walk with the dog or a trip to one of the many shops or restaurants lining Wisconsin Avenue. A Metro stop at the heart of the neighborhood provides easy access to the rest of Washington and the surrounding region. It has all the best things about being a small town with access to all the great things about being in the city.\n\nVan Ness is full of elaborate foodie, bookworm, and museum guests. Head there for some of the best taste tester tours, author talks at the local used book store, museums, and serene parks to explore.\n\nThere is a Capital bike share station right outside the Van Ness Metro so feel free to ride in style or walk around this wonderful part of your Nation’s capital with a smile.\nEnjoy plenty of shops, restaurants, and cafes, where you can get all kinds of eats and treats. You can even hop on board one of Mangia’s food tours to get the inside scoop on the best places to eat in the area.\n\nIf you’re more of an art and culture lover, this is the right place for you! Van Ness abounds with museums and galleries that you can stop by to learn more about our nation’s capital and what makes living in DC unique.Other things to noteSurveillance or recording devices on property - We use a noise monitoring device; It does NOT record actual sounds or conversations, it simply monitors the noise level (measured in decibels). Violators will be charged a $200 fine. This property may use NoiseAware technology to ensure the comfort and security of the guest.

    "description": "You’ll have the apartment to yourself.\n\n♢ Upscale DC neighborhood of Crestwood, an island of serenity east of Rock Creek Park\n♢ Hi-Speed Wi-Fi\n♢ HD SmartTV w/ Roku\n♢ Washer + dryer\n♢ 5 min drive and 20 min walk to nearest Metro subway \n♢ 10 min walk to S9 Express bus or 15 minute taxi/Uber ride to downtown Washington, DCThe Space**********************************PLEASE READ BEFORE BOOKING + ADDITIONAL RULES AT THE END **********************************************\nAs important as reading what the space offers, is understanding what it does not:\n•\tThe neighborhood is mostly families with young children and elderly residents.  Smoking of any kind or lighting fires (e.g., candles or incense) inside the unit, on premises, or in public spaces around the home is prohibited.  If you are seeking to smoke or light any sort of flames, please, kindly look for another home.\n•\tThe neighborhood is a designated drug-free zone.\n•\tWe, ourselves, are a family of four (including two young, school-aged children and at least one of us who sometimes quietly works from home).  The kids are in school M-F and often outdoors and out of the house on weekends.  However, you may still hear them, especially during dinner time – they are very sweet, I assure you.  We also sometimes play basketball in the driveway, located in front of the unit.  \n•\tThis unit is in the lower level of our home.  Please note that the rental only includes the unit itself and the immediate entryway – the front and backyards are private and, unfortunately, not open to guests at this time. \n•\tSorry, no pets allowed.\n•\tPlease note that there are outdoor security cameras on the premises.\n•\tThe unit is strictly limited to the use of up to two people.  Please respect that this is a space for paying guests, not for inviting/entertaining other guests that are not part of the reservation.\n•\tThe neighborhood is far from a busy, urban space – it is extremely quiet and residential.  It is not a place where loud noises/music, disruption, or any sort of partying is welcomed.  \n•\tCome here for the same reason we, and all our neighbors live here:  an escape, a getaway, and far enough from the action, yet still close to all DC has to offer.\n•\tIf you ever need anything – please ask.  We are very responsive and happy to help!\n**********************************************************  THANK YOU !! **********************************************************\n\nEnjoy everything DC has to offer from the lower level of my family's home, in this inviting studio apartment!  The space was designed by one of the area’s top architects and design firms and features high-end finishes, such as: Benjamin Moore’s color of the year, Simply White, throughout the home; rare and stylish Volga Blue granite countertops; a custom-made “barn-style” closet door; recessed dimmable lights; and a functional open layout.  Key-less entry, through your own private entrance, makes check-in a breeze.\n\nThe unit is perfect for both business and relaxed pleasure visits to our nation’s capital.  Just one mile away, you will find the nearest subway station, which can take you anywhere you need to be around the city and beyond.  Even closer, and only a few blocks away, you can access the S9 Express and S4 buses, which take you straight down 16th Street, and into the heart of the District in minutes!  There is also a Capital Bikeshare depot two blocks away and ample street parking. \n\nFor my more outdoorsy guests, there are two beautiful parks for hiking, nearly adjacent to the home:  Piney Branch Park and the District’s “crown jewel,” Rock Creek Park.  Critically-acclaimed restaurants, cafes, and entertainment abound in the neighboring Columbia Heights, Petworth, Mt. Pleasant, and U Street Corridor areas of the city, which are close enough to be easily accessible, but far enough away for you to comfortably enjoy the serenity of our peaceful neighborhood—we are always happy to provide you with additional recommendations, should you want them.\n\nThe studio can comfortably sleep up to a maximum of two (2) people, whether on the ultra-relaxing Serta memory foam queen bed or the chic Room & Board-designed futon sofa bed.  The unit comes fully-equipped with a kitchenette, featuring an induction burner, coffee maker, tea kettle, disposal, Delta Trinsic fixtures, full-size Samsung stainless steel fridge and freezer, as well as a washer & dryer for your laundering convenience.  The studio also has a 40” SmartTV plus Roku to stream your favorite programs.\n\n***Please Note: this is the lower-level of a home belonging to my family of four:  two adults, a 5-year old, and a 7-year old.  While we have done our best to soundproof the home, you will likely hear the noises of our active, energetic, children running and playing if you stay here.***NeighborhoodCheck out Airbnb's guide to my neighborhood → airbnb.com/things-to-do/d.c. ; airbnb.com/locations/washington-dc/16th-street-heights ;\n\nThis home is in Crestwood, a neighborhood with green lawns, beautiful houses, and quiet streets virtually devoid of traffic just to the north of Columbia Heights and Mount Pleasant. And if you’ve never heard of Crestwood, you’re not alone. The relatively peaceful, upscale residential area that sits between 16th Street and Rock Creek Park is located near some of the city’s more popular neighborhoods, but is simultaneously isolated.\n\nCrestwood is distinctly quieter than neighborhoods just a few blocks away, and there’s almost no through traffic. Many of the homes sit on large plots of land that haven’t been subdivided for new construction, and just about every lawn is green and dotted with flowering bushes. Crestwood is essentially an island of serenity east of the Park.InteractionWhile I offer self-check-in for your convenience to avoid any hassle in coordinating our schedules together, I am always only a message away should you need anything at all!Other things to noteFYI, there are outdoor security cameras on the premises.\n\nAdditional Rules:\nDo NOT flush anything other than toilet paper.  No feminine products, baby wipes, condoms, nor paper towels should be flushed at any time.  If it is found that any of these items have been flushed and clog the septic system you will be held responsible for the cost of repair.  NO smoking, no candles, no incense or lighting flames of any kind please (fire hazard).\nThis is an extremely quiet, calm part of DC.  We ask all guests to please be courteous to my neighbors and others at this property above by keeping noise volumes at a reasonable level at ALL times.  From 10 PM - 8 AM please adhere to very strict quiet hours, where noise is kept to an absolute minimum.\nThough there is no driveway parking, there is ample off-street parking for guests.  We do ask that you please be sure to park in a manner that allows the most number of cars to park on the street (e.g., you should be able to fit two cars if you park directly in front of our home).  \n\nWhile we do feel comfortable and safe in the area, we do urge all guests to be very mindful of their belongings in their vehicles and in the unit – make sure to always lock doors and keep valuables out of sight!  \n\nLastly, while the space is thoroughly insulated, we have a recently-installed 16 SEER high-efficiency Bryant HVAC unit, and we provide a thick, cozy comforter, blanket, and space heater, please be mindful that heat does rise and so basements tend to be cooler than the rest of the house during winter time.  Keeping the storm door closed at all times can help with this.  Note that the portable heater is not designed to heat the entire studio, but to provide direct heat to you for short periods (and we want to be mindful of energy costs).  Also, we are always available and on-call to adjust the temperature to maximize your comfort, so please let us know.Getting AroundI highly recommend using ride-sharing services:\nlyft.com / invited/ 5STARSTAY\nCode: 5STARSTAY\n\n→ Metro bus stops nearby \n→ 10 minute drive to the nearest metro station, Georgia Ave-Petworth",

    "description": "Our stylish and comfortable studio offers the luxury of home furnishings with the accessibility of downtown Boston and a short walk to Mass General Hospital.  \n\nLocated in the historic Beacon Hill neighborhood, you’ll be immediately swept away by the old-school charm of this neighborhood. Surrounded by brownstones, coffee shops, and locals, you’ll feel right at home in this community. Steps away from the State House, MGH, and the Boston Common, this location is nothing short of perfect.The SpaceLocated on the 1st floor, our professional managed apartment is great for those in town on business, pleasure or if you are teaching at one of the great schools in Boston. Our Temple Street apartment rental offers free 40′ Plasma TV, WiFi, utilities, Flatware, Silverware and Cooking Utensils, towels, linens and convenient access to downtown Boston.  \n\nStudio Features:\n      40″ flatscreen TV with built in WIFI\n      Direct Satellite TV\n      Grey Lacquer Kitchen Cabinets\n      All Stainless Appliances\n      Italian Carera Marble Counters\n      European Style Bathrooms\n\nProperty Features:\n      Self check-in\n      Free High Speed Wireless Internet\n      Coin-op laundry\n      Access to Iron and Ironing Board\n\nThe studio's kitchenette comes equipped with a mini fridge, microwave, two plate stove top, toaster and coffee maker.\nIn the city of Boston lodging laws dictate that heat must be provided to all those in the building October 15 - May 15. Unfortunately this means we are unable to revert the set-up during unseasonable warmth or chill. As these historic brownstones are supported by systems linked to one another ALL units must remain on the same system across the building.Guest AccessThe studio's kitchenette comes equipped with a mini fridge, microwave, two plate stove top, toaster and coffee maker.\n\nGuests have access to a set of towels and linens provided upon arrival, flatware, silverware and cooking utensils, direct satellite TV, wireless internet and coin-op Laundry which is located in the building for tenants to use.\n\nThere is an access code given to each tenant which is needed to enter the front door to the building. A unique access code is generated to the unit lock granting access to you only!\n\nParking:\nPublic transportation is the suggested form of transportation as it is only less than a 5 minute walk to the Park Street Station.  There is primarily street parking reserved for residents.  \n\nNearby garages:\n\n     Longfellow Garage (0.2 miles away from the property)\n     60 Staniford Street\n     Boston, MA\n\n     Laz Parking (less than a mile away from the property)\n     100 Cambridge Street\n     Boston, MA\n     (Intersection/Between: Cambridge St & Bowdoin St)\n     \n     Government Center Garage (0.4 miles away from the property)\n     50 New Sudbury Street\n     Boston, MANeighborhoodBeacon Hill is one of Boston’s most historic neighborhoods.\n\nClose to public transportation, the neighborhood offers antique shops, boutiques and restaurants.\n\nBeacon Hill is regarded as the most desirable and expensive neighborhood in Boston.\n\nPlease note that we are located in the heart of the city and therefore subject to noise from street construction in the fall from the City of Boston. We are not given advance notice of these projects as they are unrelated to our business. This construction is usually not active during weekends or holidays.InteractionOur concierge team is available for calls and replies online, however Maverick Suites does not employ 24hr staff on site. After hours calls are directed to an emergency answering service.Other things to note*All requests for early check-in / late check-out are subject to availability. Any granted request has a $25 associated fee and cannot be determined more than 48hours in advance. Any unauthorized late checkout will automatically be subject to a $25 penalty.*\n\nWhat we provide:\nComplimentary roll of toilet paper\nTravel size shampoo, conditioner, soap\nHair dryer\nLinens and towels- if you are staying for an extended time or prefer clean linens often, you may want to bring an extra set. We only change these when our guests complete their stay. Coin operate laundry is available in the building as well. A linen turnover is available for a $25 fee. \n\nWhat to bring:\nAny cooking materials and paper products (paper towels, napkins and toilet paper) as needed. \nThe studio is cleaned between each stay.

It is a 4cup Mr Coffee.\nAny additional toiletries you may need during your stay.Getting AroundBoston is widely known as a “walkable city” meaning you can get anywhere you need to go via foot. However, public transportation is not at a minimum at this location where you are close to both the Red Line at MGH, and the Green Line at Park Street. While walking through the streets of Beacon Hill, don’t be surprised if you stumble upon a tour group being lead by someone dressed in full colonial garb, this property is located on the Freedom Trail after all!",

We are not given advance notice of these projects as they are unrelated to our business. This construction is usually not active during weekends or holidays.InteractionOur concierge team is available for calls and replies online, however Maverick Suites does not employ 24hr staff on site.

While walking through the streets of Beacon Hill, don’t be surprised if you stumble upon a tour group being lead by someone dressed in full colonial garb, this property is located on the Freedom Trail after all!",

Surrounded by brownstones, coffee shops, and locals, you’ll feel right at home in this community. Steps away from the State House, MGH, and the Boston Common, this location is nothing short of perfect.The SpaceLocated on the 1st floor, our professional managed apartment is great for those in town on business, pleasure or if you are teaching at one of the great schools in Boston.

Unfortunately this means we are unable to revert the set-up during unseasonable warmth or chill. As these historic brownstones are supported by systems linked to one another ALL units must remain on the same system across the building.Guest AccessThe studio's kitchenette comes equipped with a mini fridge, microwave, two plate stove top, toaster and coffee maker.\n\nGuests have access to a set of towels and linens provided upon arrival, flatware, silverware and cooking utensils, direct satellite TV, wireless internet and coin-op Laundry which is located in the building for tenants to use.\n\nThere is an access code given to each tenant which is needed to enter the front door to the building. A unique access code is generated to the unit lock granting access to you only!\n\nParking:\nPublic transportation is the suggested form of transportation as it is only less than a 5 minute walk to the Park Street Station.

We are not given advance notice of these projects as they are unrelated to our business. This construction is usually not active during weekends or holidays.InteractionOur concierge team is available for calls and replies online, however Maverick Suites does not employ 24hr staff on site.

However, public transportation is not at a minimum at this location where you are close to both the Red Line at MGH, and the Green Line at Park Street.
