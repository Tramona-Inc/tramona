        <br />These Terms of Service (&ldquo;</span
      ><span class="c1 c2">Terms</span

        >&rdquo;) are a binding legal agreement between you and Tramona that
        governs your right to use the websites, applications, and other
        offerings from Tramona (collectively, the &ldquo;</span
      ><span class="c1 c2">Tramona Platform</span

      ><span class="c1"

        you are contracting. The Tramona Platform offers an online venue that
        enables users (&ldquo;</span
      ><span class="c1 c2">Members</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >&rdquo;) to publish, offer, search for, and book services. Members who

      ><span class="c1"
        >&rdquo; and Members who search for, book, or use services are

      ><span class="c1"
        >&rdquo;). You must register an account to access and use many features
        of the Tramona Platform and must keep your account information accurate.
        As the provider of the Tramona Platform, Tramona does not own, control,
        offer, or manage any Listings or Host Services. Tramona is not a party
        to the contracts entered into directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is
        Tramona a real estate broker, travel agency, or insurer. Tramona is not
        acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified
        in the Payments Terms of Service (&ldquo;</span
      ><span class="c1 c2">Payment Terms</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >&rdquo;). To learn more about Tramona&rsquo;s role see Section 16.
        <br />We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms
        like our Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and use of
        personal data, and our Payments Terms, which govern any payment services
        provided to Members by the Tramona payment entities (collectively

      ><span class="c1">. <br /></span><span class="c1 c2">2.1 Searching</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type of
        Host Service, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests.
        You can also use filters to refine your search results. Search results
        are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria.
        Relevance considers factors like price, availability, Reviews, customer
        service and cancellation history, popularity, previous<br />trips and
        saved Listings, Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights), and
        more. Learn more about search results in our Help Center. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">2.2 Booking</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your
        booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like
        Tramona&rsquo;s Service Fee, offline fees, taxes, and any other items
        identified during checkout (collectively, &ldquo;</span
      ><span class="c1 c2">Total Price</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >&rdquo;). You are also agreeing that Tramona via Tramona Payments may
        charge the Payment Method (as defined in the Payment Terms) used to book
        the Listing in order to collect Damage Claim (as defined in Section 15)
        amounts. When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host
        Services (a </span
      ><span class="c1 c2">&quot;Reservation&quot;</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >) is formed directly between you and the Host. In addition to these
        Terms, you will be subject to, and responsible for complying with, all
        terms of the Reservation, including without limitation, the cancellation
        policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements
        identified in the Listing or during checkout that apply to the
        Reservation. It is your responsibility to read and understand these
        rules, standards, policies, and requirements before booking a Listing.Be
        aware that some Hosts work with a co-host or as part of a team to
        provide their Host Services. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">2.3 Accommodation Reservations</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. An Accommodation Reservation is a limited license to enter, occupy,
        and use the Accommodation. The Host retains the right to re-enter the
        Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: that (i) it is reasonably
        necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Host, and (iii)
        consistent with applicable law. If you stay past checkout, the Host has
        the right to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law,
        including by imposing reasonable overstay penalties. You may not exceed
        the maximum number of allowed Guests.<br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2"
        >2.4 Reservations for Experiences and Other Host Services</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. An Experience or other Host Service Reservation entitles you to
        participate in, attend, or use that Host Service. You are responsible
        for confirming that you, and anyone you invite, meet minimum age,
        proficiency, fitness, or other requirements. You are responsible for
        informing the Host of any medical or physical conditions, or other
        circumstances that may impact your ability to participate, attend, or
        use the Host Service. Except where expressly authorized, you may not
        allow any person to join a Host Service unless they are included as an
        additional guest during the booking process. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">2.5 Tramona is only a referral company</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. When you book a booking on Airbnb or VRBO you agree to their
        conditions. We are not liable for what happens on an external website. </span
      ><span class="c14"
        >Tramona shall not be held liable for any experience when a booking is
        done through a website that is not www.Tramona.com<br /><br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2"
        >3. Cancellations, Travel Issues, Refunds, and Booking
        Modifications</span
      ><span class="c1">. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">3.1 Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Refunds</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. In general, if as a Guest you cancel a Reservation, the amount
        refunded to you is determined by the cancelation policy that applies to
        that Reservation. But, in certain situations, other policies take
        precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If something
        outside your control forces you to cancel a Reservation, you may be
        eligible for a partial or full refund under our extenuating
        circumstances policy. If the Host cancels, or you experience a Travel
        Issue (as defined in our rebooking and refund policy), you may be
        eligible for rebooking assistance or a partial or full refund under the
        rebooking and refund policy. Different policies apply to certain
        categories of Listings; for example, Experiences Reservations are
        governed by the experiences guest refund policy, and Luxe Reservations
        are governed by the luxe rebooking and refund policy. See each
        additional legal term or policy for details about what is covered, and
        what refund applies in each situation. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">3.2 Booking Modifications</span
      ><span class="c1"

        also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join
        or provide access to any Accommodation, Experience, or other Host
        Service. For example, this means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an
        Accommodation (and related personal property) in the condition it was in
        when you arrived, (ii) you are responsible for paying all reasonable
        Damage Claim amounts necessary to cover damage that you, your guest(s),
        or your pet(s) cause to an Accommodation, and (iii) you must act with
        integrity, treat others with respect, and comply with applicable laws at
        all times. If you are looking for an additional guest who is a minor or
        if you bring a minor to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized
        to act on behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the
        supervision of that minor. <br /></span

        that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you assume the
        entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Tramona
        Platform and any Content (as defined in Section 10), including your stay
        at any Accommodation, participation in any Experience, use of any other
        Host Service, or any other interaction you have with other Members
        whether in person or online. This means it is your responsibility to
        investigate a Host Service to determine whether it is suitable for you.
        For example, Host Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury,
        disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by
        choosing to participate in those Host Services. <br /><br />Host Terms

      ><span class="c1">. <br /></span><span class="c1 c2">5.1 Host</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. As a Host, Tramona offers you the right to use the Tramona Platform
        to share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host Services with our
        vibrant community of Guests - and earn money doing it. It&rsquo;s easy
        to create a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your
        price, availability, and rules for each Listing. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">5.2 Contracting with Guests</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. When you accept a booking request or receive a booking confirmation
        through the Tramona Platform, you are entering into a contract directly
        with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering your Host Service
        under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing. You are also
        agreeing to pay applicable fees like Tramona&rsquo;s service fee (and
        applicable taxes) for each booking. Tramona Payments will deduct amounts
        you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method.
        Any terms, policies, or conditions that you include in any supplemental
        contract with Guests must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, our
        Additional legal terms, policies, and the information provided in your
        Listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your Listing description.
        <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">5.3 Independence of Hosts</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. Your relationship with Tramona is that of an independent individual
        or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of
        Tramona, except that Tramona Payments acts as a payment collection agent
        as described in the Payments Terms. Tramona does not direct or control
        your Host Service, and you agree that you have complete discretion
        whether and when to provide Host Services, and at what price and on what
        terms to offer them. </span

      ><span class="c1">. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">6.1 Creating and Managing Your Listing</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. The Tramona Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set
        up and manage a Listing. Your Listing must include complete and accurate
        information about your Host Service, your price, other charges like
        cleaning fees, resort fees, offline fees, and any<br />rules or
        requirements that apply to your Guests or Listing. You are responsible
        for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability)
        and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times. We
        recommend that you obtain appropriate insurance for your Host Services
        and suggest you carefully review policy terms and conditions including
        coverage details and exclusions. You may only maintain one Listing per
        Accommodation but may have multiple Listings for a single property if it
        has multiple places to stay. Any offer of an Experience is subject to
        our Additional Terms for Experience Hosts. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">6.2 Know Your Legal Obligations</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. You are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws,
        rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to your
        Listing or Host Services. For example: Some landlords and leases, or
        homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit
        subletting, short-term rentals, and/or longer-term stays. Some cities
        have zoning or other laws that restrict the short-term rental of
        residential properties. Some jurisdictions require Hosts to register,
        get a permit, or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services
        (such as short-term rentals, longer-term stays, preparing food, serving
        alcohol for sale, guiding tours, or operating a vehicle). In some
        places, the Host Services you want to offer may be prohibited
        altogether. Some jurisdictions require that you register Guests who stay
        at your Accommodation. Some jurisdictions have laws that create tenancy
        rights for Guests and additional obligations for Hosts. For example,
        some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws that
        may apply to longer stays. Check your local rules to learn what rules
        apply to the Host Services you plan to offer. Information we provide
        regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you
        should independently confirm your obligations. You are responsible for
        handling and using the personal data of Guests and others in compliance
        with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including our Host Privacy
        Standards. If you have questions about how local laws apply you should
        always seek legal advice. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">6.3 Search Ranking</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. The ranking of Listings in search results on the Tramona Platform
        depends on a variety of factors, including these main parameters:
        <br /><br />&#9679; Guest search parameters (e.g. number of Guests, time
        and duration of the trip, price range), &#9679; Listing characteristics
        (e.g. price, calendar availability, number and quality of images,
        Reviews, type of Host Service, Host status, age of the Listing, average
        Guest popularity), &#9679; Guest booking experience (e.g. customer
        service and cancellation history of the Host, ease of booking),
        <br />&#9679; Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights, booking
        cut-off time), and &#9679; Guest preferences (e.g. previous trips, saved
        Listings, the location from where the Guest is searching).
        <br /><br />Search results may appear different on our mobile
        application than they appear on our website. Tramona may allow Hosts to
        promote their Listings in search or elsewhere on the Tramona Platform by
        paying an additional fee. More information about the factors that
        determine how your Listing appears in search results, our current
        promotional programs (if any), and how we identify promoted Content can
        be found in our Help Center. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">6.4 Your Responsibilities</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. You are responsible and liable for your acts and omissions and are
        also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you allow to
        participate in providing your Host Services. You are responsible for
        setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your
        Listing. You must describe any and all fees and charges in your Listing
        description and may not<br />collect any additional fees or charges
        outside the Tramona Platform except those expressly authorized by our
        Offline Fee Policy. Do not encourage Guests to create third-party
        accounts, submit reviews, provide their contact information, or take
        other actions outside the Tramona Platform in violation of our
        Off-Platofrm Policy. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">6.5 Hosting as a Team or Organization</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. If you work with a co-host or host as part of a team, business, or
        other organization, the entity and each individual who participates in
        providing Host Services is responsible and liable as a Host under these
        Terms. If you accept terms or enter into contracts, you represent and
        warrant that you are authorized to enter into contracts for and bind
        your team, business, or other organization, and that each entity you use
        is in good standing under the laws of the place where it is established.
        If you perform other functions, you represent and warrant that you are
        authorized to perform those functions. If you instruct Tramona to
        transfer a portion of your payout to a co-host or other Hosts, or to
        send payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and are
        responsible and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any
        payout information you provide. <br /></span

        assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the
        Tramona Platform, offering Host Services, or any interaction you have
        with other Members whether in person or online. You agree that you have
        had the opportunity to investigate the Tramona Platform and any laws,
        rules, regulations, or obligations that may be applicable to your
        Listings or Host Services and that you are not relying upon any
        statement of law made by Tramona. <br />7. Cancellations, Travel Issues,

      ><span class="c1 c2">7.1 Cancellations and Travel Issues</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. In general, if a Guest cancels a Reservation, the amount paid to you
        is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that
        Reservation. As a host, you should not cancel on a Guest without a valid
        reason under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy or applicable law. If
        you cancel on a Guest without such a valid reason, we may impose a
        cancellation fee and other consequences. If: (i) a Guest experiences a
        Travel Issue (as defined by the Reebooking and Refund Policy), (ii) an
        Extenuating Circumstance arises, or (iii) a Reservation is canceled
        under Section 13 of these Terms, the amount you are paid will be reduced
        by the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the Guest, and by any
        other reasonable costs we incur as a result of the cancellation. If a
        Guest receives a refund after you have already been paid, or the amount
        of the refund and other costs incurred by Tramona exceeds your payout,
        Tramona (via Tramona Payments) may recover that amount from you,
        including by offsetting the refund against your future payouts. You
        agree that Tramona&rsquo;s Reebooking and Refund Policy Extentutating
        Circumstances Policy, and these Terms preempt the cancellation policy
        you set in situations where they allow for the cancellation of a
        Reservation and/or the issuance of refunds to Guests. If we reasonably
        expect to provide a refund to a Guest under one of these policies, we
        may delay release of any payout for that Reservation until a refund
        decision is made. If you Host an Experience please note that the
        Experience Cancellation Policy, Experiences Guest Refund Policy and
        different cancellation fees and consequences apply to your Reservations.
        See each Policy for details about what is covered, and what your payout
        will be in each situation. <br /></span

        remittance of Taxes on behalf of Hosts, you instruct and authorize
        Tramona to collect Taxes on your behalf, and/or to remit such Taxes to
        the relevant Tax authority. Any Taxes that are collected <br />and/or
        remitted by Tramona are identified to Members on their transaction

        that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully
        discharge that Members&rsquo; tax obligations and you agree that your

        applicable Tax authority. You acknowledge and agree that we retain the

        Taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as
        required by law, until sufficient documentation is provided. You agree
        that Tramona may issue on your behalf invoices or similar documentation
        for VAT, GST, consumption or other Taxes for your Host Services to
        facilitate accurate tax reporting by you, our Guests, and/or their

        or if the Damage Claim is escalated to Tramona and Tramona determines in
        its sole discretion that the Damage Claim is valid and you are

        to publish, offer, search for, and book Host Services. While we work
        hard to ensure our Members have great experiences using Tramona, we do
        not and cannot control the conduct of Guests and Hosts. You acknowledge
        that Tramona has the right, but does not have any obligation, to monitor
        the use of the Tramona Platform and verify information provided by our
        Members. For example, we may review, disable access to, remove, or edit
        Content to: (i) operate, secure, and improve the Tramona Platform
        (including for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation, and
        customer support purposes); (ii) ensure Members&rsquo; compliance with
        these Terms; (iii) comply with applicable law or the order or
        requirement of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency
        or governmental body; (iv) address Content that we determine is harmful
        or objectionable; (v) take actions set out in these Terms; and (vi)
        maintain and enforce any quality or eligibility criteria, including by
        removing Listings that don&rsquo;t meet quality and eligibility
        criteria. Members acknowledge and agree that Tramona administers its
        Additional Legal Terms, Policies (such as our Extenuating Circumstances
        Policy), and Standards (such as basic requirements for hosts), including
        decisions about whether and how to apply them to a particular situation,
        at its sole discretion. Members agree to cooperate with and assist
        Tramona in good faith to provide Tramona with such information and take
        such actions as may be reasonably requested by Tramona with respect to
        any investigation undertaken by Tramona regarding the use or abuse of
        the Tramona Platform. Tramona is not acting as an agent for any Member
        except for where Tramona Payments acts as a collection agent as provided
        in the Payments Terms. <br /></span

        your credentials have been lost, or stolen, or your account is otherwise
        compromised. If and as permitted by applicable law, we may, but have no
        obligation to (i) ask you to provide identification or other
        information, (ii) undertake checks designed to help verify your identity
        or background, (iii) screen you against third-party databases or other

        exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data
        or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system
        failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any
        damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out
        of or in connection with (i) these Terms, (ii) the use of or inability
        to use the Tramona Platform or any Content, (iii) any communications,

        with through, or as a result of, your use of the Tramona Platform, or
        (iv) publishing or booking of a Listing, including the provision or use
        of Host Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including
        negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or
        not Tramona has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if
        a limited remedy set out in these Terms is found to have failed of its
        essential purpose. <br />Except for our obligation to transmit payments
        to Hosts under these Terms, or make payments under the Tramona Host
        Damage Protection or Japan Host Insurance, in no event will
        Tramona&rsquo;s aggregate liability for any claim or dispute arising out
        of or in connection with these Terms, your interaction with any Members,
        or your use of or inability to use the Tramona Platform, any Content, or
        any Host Service, exceed: (A) to Guests, the amount you paid as a Guest
        during the 12-month period prior to the event giving rise to the
        liability, (B) to Hosts, the amount paid to you as a Host in the
        12-month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or (C)
        to anyone else, one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100). <br />These
        limitations of liability and damages are fundamental elements of the
        agreement between you and Tramona. If applicable law does not allow the
        limitations of liability set out in these Terms, the above limitations
        may not apply to you. <br />20. Indemnification</span

        harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and

        <br />21. Contracting Entities</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. <br />Based on your country of residence or establishment and what
        you are doing on the Tramona Platform, Schedule 1 below sets out the
        Tramona entity with whom you are contracting. If we identify through the
        Tramona Platform, a Tramona entity other than the one set out on
        Schedule 1 as being responsible for a product, feature, or transaction,
        the Tramona entity so identified is your contracting entity with respect
        to that product, feature, or transaction. If you change your country of
        residence or establishment, the Tramona company you contract with (as
        set out on Schedule 1) and the applicable version of the Terms of
        Service will be determined by your new country of residence or
        establishment, from the date on which your country of residence or
        establishment changes. </span

        to conflict-of-law provisions. Judicial proceedings (other than small
        claims actions) that are excluded from the arbitration agreement in
        Section 23 must be brought in state or federal court in Seattle,
        Washington unless we both agree to some other location. You and I both
        consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in Seattle, Washington.

        residence or establishment is the United States. If your country of
        residence or establishment is not the United States, and you
        nevertheless attempt to bring any legal claim against Tramona in the
        United States, this Arbitration Agreement will apply for determination
        of the threshold issue of whether this Section 23 applies to you, and
        all other threshold determinations, including residency, arbitrability,
        venue, and applicable law. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">23.2 Overview of Dispute Resolution Process</span

        resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part
        process for individuals to whom this Section 23 applies: (1) an informal
        negotiation directly with Tramona&rsquo;s customer service team
        (described in paragraph 23.3, below), and if necessary (2) a binding
        arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
        (&ldquo;</span
      ><span class="c1 c2">AAA</span
      ><span class="c1"

        attempt in good faith to negotiate an informal resolution. You must send
        your notice of dispute to Tramona by mailing it to Tramona at </span

        of dispute to the email address associated with your Tramona account. A
        notice of dispute must include: the party&rsquo;s name and preferred
        contact information, a brief description of the dispute, and the relief
        sought. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within the
        30-day period, only then may either party commence arbitration by filing
        a written Demand for Arbitration (available at </span
      ><span class="c6">www.adr.org</span

      ><span class="c1"

        claims for relief are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will

        emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g.,

        >23.8 Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney&rsquo;s Fees and Costs</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall
        be governed by the AAA Rules. Either party may make a request that the
        arbitrator award attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs upon proving that the
        other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim, or defense that is
        groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith or for the purpose of
        harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, as allowed by applicable law and
        the AAA Rules. </span
      ><span class="c1 c2">23.9 Arbitrator&rsquo;s Decision</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision will include the essential findings
        and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on
        the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper
        jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or the
        AAA Rules, but declaratory or injunctive relief may be awarded only on
        an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
        warranted by the claimant&rsquo;s individual claim. </span
      ><span class="c1 c2">23.10 Jury Trial Waiver</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. You and Tramona acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the
        right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.<br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2"
        >23.11 No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. You and Tramona acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent
        permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to participate as a
        plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit,
        class-wide arbitration, private attorney general action, or any other
        representative or consolidated proceeding. Unless we agree in writing,
        the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party&rsquo;s claims
        and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or
        representative proceeding. If there is a final judicial determination
        that applicable law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in
        this paragraph as to any claim, cause of action, or requested remedy,
        then that claim, cause of action, or requested remedy, and only that
        claim, cause of action or requested remedy, will be severed from this
        agreement to arbitrate and will be brought in a court of competent
        jurisdiction. In the event that a claim, cause of action, or requested
        remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that
        the claims, causes of action, or requested remedies that are not subject
        to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of
        action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator. </span
      ><span class="c1 c2">23.12 Severability</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. Except as provided in Section 23.11, in the event that any portion of
        this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such
        provision will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement
        will be given full force and effect. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">23.13 Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. If Tramona changes this Section 23 after the date you last accepted
        these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may
        reject that change by sending us written notice (including by email)
        within 30 days of the date the change is effective. Rejecting a new
        change, however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any
        earlier agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and Tramona (or
        your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will remain
        in effect and enforceable as to any Dispute between you and Tramona.

        to apply even if you stop using the Tramona Platform or terminate your

        to conflict of laws provisions and shall not be construed to limit any

        regard to conflict-of-law provisions. Legal proceedings that you are
        able to bring against us arising from or in connection with these Terms

        Terms will be interpreted in accordance with Irish law. The application
        of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale

        you, such provisions shall apply irrespective of the choice of Irish
        law. As an individual consumer, you may bring any judicial proceedings
        relating to these Terms before the competent court of your place of
        residence or the competent court of Tramona&#39;s place of business in
        Ireland. If Tramona wishes to enforce any of its rights against you as a

        you are a resident. If you are acting as a business, you agree to submit
        to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish courts. <br /></span

        understandings or agreements between Tramona and you. These Terms do not
        and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon anyone other
        than you and Tramona. If any provision of these Terms is held to be
        invalid or unenforceable, except as otherwise indicated in Section 23.11
        above, such provision will be struck and will not affect the validity
        and enforceability of the remaining provisions. Where the word

        acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. Except as expressly set
        forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its

        offer, or manage any Listings, Host Services, or tourism services.
        Tramona is not a party to the contracts entered into directly between

        From cabins to castles to cooking classes, browse through millions of
        Listings to find the ones that fit the way you like to travel. Learn
        more about a Listing by reviewing the description and photos, the Host

      ><span class="c1">. <br /></span><span class="c1 c2">2.1 Searching</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type of
        Host Service, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests.
        You can also use filters to refine your search results. Search results
        are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria.
        Relevance considers factors like price, availability, Reviews, customer
        service and cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved
        Listings, Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights), and more.
        Learn more about search results in our Help Center. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">2.2 Booking</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your
        booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like
        Tramona&rsquo;s Service Fee, offline fees, taxes, and any other items
        identified during checkout (collectively, &ldquo;</span
      ><span class="c1 c2">Total Price</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >&rdquo;). When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for
        Host Services (a &quot;</span
      ><span class="c1 c2">Reservation</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >&quot;) is formed directly between you and the Host. In addition to
        these Terms, you will be subject to, and responsible for complying with,
        all terms of the Reservation, including without limitation, the
        cancellation policy and any other rules, standards,<br />policies, or
        requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout that apply to
        the Reservation. It is your responsibility to read and understand these
        rules, standards, policies, and requirements prior to booking a Listing.
        Be aware that some Hosts work with a co-host or as part of a team to
        provide their Host Services. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">2.3 Accommodation Reservations</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. An Accommodation Reservation is a limited license to enter, occupy,
        and use the Accommodation. The Host retains the right to re-enter the
        Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i) it is reasonably
        necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Host, and (iii)
        consistent with applicable law. If you stay past checkout, the Host has
        the right to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law,
        including by imposing reasonable overstay penalties. You may not exceed
        the maximum number of allowed Guests. </span
      ><span class="c1 c2"
        >2.4 Reservations for Experiences and Other Host Services</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. An Experience or other Host Service Reservation entitles you to
        participate in, attend, or use that Host Service. You are responsible
        for confirming that you, and anyone you invite, meet minimum age,
        proficiency, fitness, or other requirements. You are responsible for
        informing the Host of any medical or physical conditions, or other
        circumstances that may impact your ability to participate, attend, or
        use the Host Service. Except where expressly authorized, you may not
        allow any person to join a Host Service unless they are included as an
        additional guest during the booking process. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2"
        >3. Cancellations, Travel Issues, Refunds, and Booking
        Modifications</span
      ><span class="c1">. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">3.1 Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Refunds</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. In general, if you cancel a reservation, the amount refunded to you
        is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that
        reservation. But, in certain situations, other policies take precedence
        and determine what amount is refunded to you. If something outside your
        control requires you to cancel a reservation, you may be entitled to a
        partial or full refund under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy. If
        the Host cancels, or you experience a Travel Issue (as defined in our
        Rebooking and Refund Policy), you may be entitled to rebooking
        assistance or a partial or full refund under our Rebooking and Refund
        Policy. Different policies apply to certain categories of Listings; for
        example, Experiences reservations are governed by the Experiences Guest
        Refund Policy, and Luxe Reservations are governed by the Luxe Rebooking
        and Refund Policy. See each Additional Legal Term or Policy for details
        about what is covered, and what refund applies in each situation. You
        may appeal a decision by Tramona by contacting our customer service.
        <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">3.2 Booking Modifications</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. Hosts and Guests are responsible for any booking modifications they
        agree to make via the Tramona Platform or direct Tramona customer
        service to make on their behalf (&quot;</span
      ><span class="c1 c2">Booking Modifications</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >&quot;), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees or taxes
        associated with any Booking Modification. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">4. Your Responsibilities</span
      ><span class="c1">. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2"
        >You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also
        responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or
        provide access to any Accommodation or Experience. For example, this
        means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an Accommodation (and related
        personal property) in the condition it was in when you arrived, (ii) you
        are responsible for paying all Damage Claim amounts necessary to cover
        damage that you, your guest(s), or your pet(s) cause to an
        Accommodation, and (iii) you must act with integrity, treat others with
        respect and comply with applicable laws at all times. If you are booking
        for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a Host
        Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor
        and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor.<br />Host

      ><span class="c1">. <br /></span><span class="c1 c2">5.1 Host</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. As a Host, Tramona offers you the right to use the Tramona Platform
        to share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host Services with our
        vibrant community of Guests - and earn money doing it. It&rsquo;s easy
        to create a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your
        price, availability, and rules for each Listing. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">5.2 Contracting with Guests</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. When you accept a booking request or receive a booking confirmation
        through the Tramona Platform, you are entering into a contract directly
        with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering the Host Service
        under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing. You are also
        agreeing to pay applicable fees like Tramona&rsquo;s Service Fee (and
        applicable taxes) for each booking. Tramona Payments will deduct amounts
        you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method.
        Any terms or conditions that you include in any supplement contract with
        Guests must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, our Additional Legal
        Terms, Policies, and the information provided in your Listing, and (ii)
        be prominently disclosed in your Listing description. </span
      ><span class="c1 c2">5.3 Independence of Hosts</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. Your relationship with Tramona is that of an independent individual
        or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of
        Tramona, except that Tramona Payments acts as a payment collection agent
        as described in the Payments Terms. Tramona does not direct or control
        your Host Service and you understand that you have complete discretion
        whether and when to provide Host Services and at what price and on what
        terms to offer them. </span
      ><span class="c1 c2">6. Managing Your Listing</span
      ><span class="c1">. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">6.1 Creating and Managing Your Listing</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. The Tramona Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set
        up and manage a Listing. Your Listing must include complete and accurate
        information about your Host Service, your price, other charges like
        cleaning fees, resort fees, offline fees, and any rules or requirements
        that apply to your Guests or Listing. You are responsible for your acts
        and omissions as well as for keeping your Listing information (including
        calendar availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate
        at all times. We recommend that you obtain appropriate insurance for
        your Host Services and suggest you carefully review policy terms and
        conditions like coverage details and exclusions. You may only maintain
        one Listing per Accommodation but may have multiple Listings for a
        single property if it has multiple places to stay. Any offer of an
        Experience is subject to our Additional Terms for Experience Hosts. </span
      ><span class="c1 c2">6.2 Know Your Legal Obligations</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. You are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws,
        rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to your
        Listing or Host Services. For example: Some landlords and leases, or
        homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit
        subletting, short-term rentals, and/or longer-term stays. Some cities
        have zoning or other laws that restrict the short-term rental of
        residential properties. Some jurisdictions require Hosts to register,
        get a permit, or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services
        (such as short-term rentals, longer-term stays, preparing food, serving
        alcohol for sale, guiding tours, or operating a vehicle). In some
        places, the Host Services you want to offer may be prohibited
        altogether. Some jurisdictions require that you register Guests who stay
        at your Accommodation. Some jurisdictions have laws that create tenancy
        rights for Guests and additional obligations for Hosts. For example,
        some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws that
        may apply to longer stays. Check your local rules to learn what rules
        apply to the Host Services you plan to offer. Information we provide
        regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you
        should<br />independently confirm your obligations. You are responsible
        for handling and using personal data of Guests and others in compliance
        with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including our Host Privacy
        Standard. If you have questions about how local laws apply you should
        always seek legal advice. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">6.3 Search Ranking</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. The ranking of Listings in search results on the Tramona Platform
        depends on a variety of factors, including these main parameters:
        <br /><br />&#9679; Guest search parameters (e.g. number of Guests, time
        and duration of the trip, price range), &#9679; Listing characteristics
        (e.g. price, calendar availability, number and quality of images,
        Reviews, type of Host Service, host status, age of the Listing, average
        Guest popularity), &#9679; Guest booking experience (e.g. customer
        service and cancellation history of the Host, ease of booking),
        <br />&#9679; Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights, booking
        cut-off time), and &#9679; Guest preferences (e.g. previous trips, saved
        Listings, location from where the Guest is searching).
        <br /><br />Search results may appear different on our mobile
        application than they appear on our website. Tramona may allow Hosts to
        promote their Listings in search or elsewhere on the Tramona Platform by
        paying an additional fee. More information about the factors that
        determine how your Listing appears in search results, our current
        promotional programs (if any) and how we identify promoted Content can
        be found in our Help Center. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">6.4 Your Responsibilities</span
      ><span class="c1">. </span
      ><span class="c1 c2"
        >You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also
        responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you allow to
        participate in providing your Host Services. You are responsible for
        setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your
        Listing. You must describe any and all fees and charges in your Listing
        description and may not collect any additional fees or charges outside
        the Tramona Platform except those expressly authorized by our Offline
        Fee Policy. Do not encourage Guests to create third-party accounts,
        submit reviews, provide their contact information, or take other actions
        outside the Tramona Platform in violation of our Off-Platform Policy.
        <br />6.5 Hosting as a Team or Organization</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. If you work with a co-host or host as part of a team, business, or
        other organization, the entity and each individual who participates in
        providing Host Services, is responsible and liable as a Host under these
        Terms. If you accept terms or enter into contracts, you represent and
        warrant that you are authorized to enter into contracts for and bind
        your team, business, or other organization, and that each entity you use
        is in good standing under the laws of the place where it is established.
        If you perform other functions, you represent and warrant that you are
        authorized to perform those functions. If you instruct Tramona to
        transfer a portion of your payout to a co-host or other Hosts or send
        payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and are
        responsible and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any
        payout information you provide. <br /></span

      ><span class="c1">. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">7.1 Cancellations and Travel Issues</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. In general, if a Guest cancels a reservation, the amount paid to you
        is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that
        reservation. As a host, you should not cancel on a Guest without a valid
        reason under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy or applicable law. If
        you cancel on a Guest without such a valid reason, we may impose a
        cancellation fee and other consequences. If: (i) a Guest experiences a
        Travel Issue (as defined by the Rebooking<br />and Refund Policy), (ii)
        an Extenuating Circumstances arises, or (iii) a reservation is cancelled
        under Section 13 of these Terms, the amount you are paid will be reduced
        by the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the Guest, and by any
        other reasonable costs we incur as a result of the cancellation. If a
        Guest receives a refund after you have already been paid, or the amount
        of the refund and other costs incurred by Tramona exceeds your payout,
        Tramona (via Tramona Payments) may recover that amount from you,
        including by offsetting the refund against your future payouts. You
        agree that Tramona&rsquo;s Rebooking and Refund Policy, Extenuating
        Circumstances Policy, and these Terms preempt the cancellation policy
        you set in situations where they allow for the cancellation of a
        Reservation and/or the issuance of refunds to Guests. If we reasonably
        expect to provide a refund to a Guest under one of these policies, we
        may delay the release of any payout for that Reservation until a refund
        decision is made. If you Host an Experience please note that the
        Experience Cancellation Policy, Experiences Guest Refund Policyand
        different cancellation fees and consequences apply to your Reservations.
        See each policy for details about what is covered, and what your payout
        will be in each situation. You may appeal a decision by Tramona by
        contacting our customer service. <br /></span

        remittance of Taxes on behalf of Hosts, you instruct and authorize
        Tramona to collect Taxes on your behalf, and/or to remit such Taxes to
        the relevant Tax authority. Any Taxes that are collected <br />and/or
        remitted by Tramona are identified to Members on their transaction
        records, as applicable. Tramona may seek additional amounts from Members
        (including by deducting such amounts from future payouts) in the event
        that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully
        discharge that Members&rsquo; tax obligations and you agree that your
        sole remedy for Taxes collected by Tramona is a refund from the
        applicable Tax authority. You acknowledge and agree that we retain the
        right, with prior notice to affected Members, to cease the collection

        you, or both. If you fail to provide us with documentation that we
        determine to be sufficient to support any such obligation to withhold
        Taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as
        required by law, until sufficient documentation is provided. You agree
        that Tramona may issue on your behalf invoices or similar documentation
        for VAT, GST, consumption or other Taxes for your Host Services to
        facilitate accurate tax reporting by our Guests and their organizations.

      ><span class="c1"
        >. <br />15.1 If a Member provides valid evidence that you, your
        guest(s), or your pet(s) culpably damaged the complaining Member&rsquo;s
        real or personal property or real or personal property the complaining
        Member is responsible for, including consequential damages,
        (&quot;Damage Claim&quot;), the complaining Member can notify Tramona
        and/or seek compensation through the Resolution Center. You will be
        notified of the Damage Claim and given an opportunity to respond. If you
        agree to pay, you authorize Tramona via Tramona Payments to collect the
        amount of the Damage Claim from you. 15.2 If the Host and Guest cannot
        resolve, or a Guest fails to pay a Damage Claim, the Host may notify
        Tramona through the Resolution Center under the terms of the Host Damage
        Protection Terms and seek compensation. Tramona will review the Damage
        Claim and ask the Host to provide any required evidence (e.g. through
        appropriate documents, photos, invoices, or third-party experts) that
        substantiates the Damage Claim and the Damage Claim amount. The Guest
        will be given the opportunity to respond and provide any relevant
        counter-evidence. If Tramona determines, under consideration of the
        evidence provided, the Host Damage Protection Terms, and applicable
        statutory rules on the burden of proof that the Guest is responsible for
        the Damage Claim, Tramona (via Tramona Payments) will pay out the Damage
        Claim to the Host. If Tramona pays out the Damage Claim to the Host,
        Tramona may collect the amount of the Damage Claim from the Guest,
        including by charging the guest&rsquo;s Payment Method up to a maximum
        amount of $500 USD. Tramona may also pursue claims for recovering Damage
        Claims amounts, including amounts exceeding the maximum amount
        applicable for charging the Guest&rsquo;s Payment Method, against a
        Guest using any remedies it may have available under applicable law,
        including referral of the matter to a collections agency, and/or pursuit
        of available causes of action and/or claims against a Guest. Members may
        appeal a decision by Tramona by contacting our customer service. As
        between Members and Tramona, the burden of proof regarding the Damage
        Claim and the Damage Claim amount always lies with Tramona. <br />15.3
        You agree to cooperate in good faith, provide any information Tramona
        requests, execute documents, and take further reasonable action, in
        connection with Damage Claims, Member complaints, claims under insurance
        policies, or other claims related to your provision or use of Host
        Services. <br />15.4 Any decisions made by Tramona in relation to a
        Damage Claim do not affect your contractual and statutory rights. Your
        right to take legal action before a court of law remains unaffected.<br /></span

        to publish, offer, search for, and book Host Services. When Members make
        or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with
        each other. Tramona is not and does not become a party to or other
        participant in any contractual relationship between Members. Tramona is
        not acting as an agent for any Member except for where Tramona Payments
        acts as a collection agent as provided in the Payments Terms. While we
        work hard to ensure our Members have great experiences using Tramona, we
        do not and cannot control the conduct or performance of Guests and Hosts
        and do not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or
        legality of any Listings or Host Services or (ii) the truth or accuracy
        of any Listing descriptions, Reviews, or other Content provided by
        Members. You acknowledge that Tramona has no general obligation to
        monitor the use of the Tramona Platform and verify information provided
        by our Members, but has the right to review, disable access to, remove,
        or edit Content to: (i) operate, secure and improve the Tramona Platform
        (including for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation, and
        customer support purposes); (ii) ensure Members&rsquo; compliance with
        these Terms; (iii) comply with applicable law or the order or
        requirement of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency
        or governmental body; (iv) address Member Content that we determine is
        harmful or objectionable; (v) take actions set out in these Terms; and
        (vi) maintain and enforce any quality or eligibility criteria, including
        by removing Listings that don&rsquo;t meet quality and eligibility
        criteria. Where we remove or disable Content, we will notify a Member
        and provide the reasons for such a measure, unless such notification
        would (i) prevent or impede the detection or prevention of fraud or
        other illegal activities, (ii) harm the legitimate interests of other
        Members or third parties, or (iii) contravene applicable laws. You may
        appeal such a decision by contacting our customer service. Members agree
        to cooperate with and assist Tramona in good faith to provide Tramona
        with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably
        requested by Tramona with respect to any investigation undertaken by

        this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity

        vicarious agents. The same applies to the assumption of guarantees or
        any other strict liability, or in case of a culpable injury to life,
        limb, or health. For any negligent breaches of essential contractual
        obligations by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other
        vicarious agents Tramona&rsquo;s liability is limited to the typically
        occurring foreseeable damages. Essential contractual obligations are
        such duties of Tramona in whose proper fulfillment you regularly trust
        and must trust for the proper execution of the contract. Any additional
        liability of Tramona is excluded. To the extent that Tramona&#39;s
        liability is excluded or limited, this also applies with regard to the
        personal liability of its legal representatives, directors, employees,
        and other agents. <br /></span

      ><span class="c1"
        >. This Arbitration Agreement only applies to you if your country of
        residence or establishment is the United States. If your country of
        residence or establishment is not the United States, and you
        nevertheless attempt to bring any legal claim against Tramona in the
        United States, this Arbitration Agreement will apply for determination
        of the threshold issue of whether this Section 24 applies to you, and
        all other threshold determinations, including residency, arbitrability,
        venue, and applicable law. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">24.2 Overview of Dispute Resolution Process</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. Tramona is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute
        resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part
        process for individuals to whom this Section 24 applies: (1) an informal
        negotiation directly with Tramona&rsquo;s customer service team
        (described in paragraph 24.3, below), and if necessary (2) a binding
        arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
        (&ldquo;</span
      ><span class="c1 c2">AAA</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >&rdquo;). You and Tramona each retain the right to seek resolution of
        the dispute in small claims court as an alternative to arbitration.
        <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2"
        >24.3 Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and
        Notification</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. At least 30 days prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Tramona
        each agree to notify the other party of the dispute in writing and
        attempt in good faith to negotiate an informal resolution. You must send
        your notice of dispute to Tramona by mailing it to 2314 236th Av Ne
        Samm. WA. Tramona will send its notice of dispute to the email address
        associated with your Tramona account. A notice of dispute must include:
        the party&rsquo;s name and preferred contact information, a brief
        description of the dispute, and the relief sought. If the parties are
        unable to resolve the dispute within the 30-day period, only then may
        either party commence arbitration by filing a written Demand for
        Arbitration (available at </span
      ><span class="c6">www.adr.org</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >) with the AAA and providing a copy to the other party as specified in

      ><span class="c1">. </span
      ><span class="c1 c2"

        arising out of or relating to these Terms or the applicability, breach,
        termination, validity, enforcement, or interpretation thereof, or any
        use of the Tramona Platform, Host Services, or any Content
        (collectively, &ldquo;</span

        &ldquo;</span
      ><span class="c1">Arbitration Agreement</span

        agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue. 24.5 Exceptions to
        Arbitration Agreement</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. You and Tramona each agree that the following causes of action and/or
        claims for relief are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will
        be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction
        (as defined by Section 22 of the Terms of Service for Non-European
        Users): (i) any claim or cause of action alleging actual or threatened
        infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&rsquo;s
        copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual
        property rights; (ii) any claim or cause of action seeking emergency
        injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger
        or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack); or (iii) a request for
        the remedy of public injunctive relief; or (iv) any individual claim of
        sexual assault or sexual harassment arising from your use of the Tramona
        Platform or Host Services. You and Tramona agree that the remedy of
        public injunctive relief will proceed after the<br />arbitration of all
        arbitrable claims, remedies, or causes of action, and will be stayed
        pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the
        Federal Arbitration Act. </span
      ><span class="c1 c2">24.6 Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate
        commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act governs all substantive and
        procedural interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The
        arbitration will be administered by the arbitrator in accordance with
        the Consumer Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules
        determined to be applicable by the AAA (the &ldquo;</span
      ><span class="c1 c2">AAA Rules</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >&ldquo;) then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are
        available at </span
      ><span class="c6">www.adr.org</span
      ><span class="c1"

        (available at </span
      ><span class="c6">www.adr.org</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >) must be filed with the AAA and provided to the other party, as
        specified in the AAA rules. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2"
        >24.7 Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, Tramona
        agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your
        option: (a) in the U.S. county where you reside; (b) in King County; (c)
        via phone or video conference. If the amount in controversy is $5,000 or
        less, the parties agree to proceed solely on the submission of documents
        to the arbitrator. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2"
        >24.8 Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney&rsquo;s Fees and Costs</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall
        be governed by the AAA Rules. Either party may make a request that the
        arbitrator award attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs upon proving that the
        other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim, or defense that is
        groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith or for the purpose of
        harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, as allowed by applicable law and
        the AAA Rules. </span
      ><span class="c1 c2">24.9 Arbitrator&rsquo;s Decision</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision will include the essential findings
        and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on
        the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper
        jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or the
        AAA Rules, but declaratory or injunctive relief may be awarded only on
        an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
        warranted by the claimant&rsquo;s individual claim. </span
      ><span class="c1 c2">24.10 Jury Trial Waiver</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. You and Tramona acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the
        right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes. <br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2"
        >24.11 No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. You and Tramona acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent
        permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to participate as a
        plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit,
        class-wide arbitration, private attorney general action, or any other
        representative or consolidated proceeding. Unless we agree in writing,
        the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party&rsquo;s claims
        and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or
        representative proceeding. If there is a final judicial determination
        that applicable law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in
        this paragraph as to any claim, cause of action, or requested remedy,
        then that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, and only that
        claim, cause of action or requested remedy, will be severed from this
        agreement to arbitrate and will be brought in a court of competent
        jurisdiction. In the event that a claim, cause of action, or requested
        remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that
        the claims, causes of action, or requested remedies that are not subject
        to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of
        action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator. </span
      ><span class="c1 c2">24.12 Severability</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. Except as provided in Section 24.11, in the event that any portion of
        this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such
        provision will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement
        will be given full force and effect.<br /></span
      ><span class="c1 c2">24.13 Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate</span
      ><span class="c1"
        >. If Tramona changes this Section 24 after the date you last accepted
        these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may
        reject that change by sending us written notice (including by email)
        within 30 days of the date the change is effective. Rejecting a new
        change, however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any
        earlier agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and Tramona (or
        your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will remain
        in effect and enforceable as to any Dispute between you and Tramona.

        any termination of these Terms and will continue to apply even if you
