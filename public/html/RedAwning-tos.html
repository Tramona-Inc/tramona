    <h1>RedAwning.com Full Rental Terms</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>This Property Rental Agreement is made by and between the owner, either directly or through its authorized leasing agent ("Owner") of a vacation rental property ("Property"), the renter of the Property ("Guest"), and RedAwning.com, Inc., a California corporation ("RedAwning") (each, a "party", collectively, the "parties"). This Property Rental Agreement and all exhibits, linked pages and attachments referenced below, which by this reference are incorporated herein as though fully set forth, are, together, the "Agreement". Guest desires to rent the Property from Owner, Owner desires to rent the Property to Guest, and RedAwning desires to facilitate such rental, all upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Rental Specifics</h2>
        <p>Guest and Owner agree to the specific terms of the vacation property rental ("Booking") set forth on the RedAwning Booking Summary ("Booking Summary"), including without limitation, the Property description, any additional terms referenced or linked from the Property description page, the rental dates, the rental charges, the cancellation policy, the damage reporting procedure, the cleaning fees, the deposit amounts and total charges, all of which terms are by this reference incorporated into this Agreement as though fully set forth. The terms of the Booking Summary shall control any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Booking Summary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. General Terms</h2>
        <p>The following terms shall apply to the Booking:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Check-In. Check-In Time is usually 4PM, but please review your check-in instructions for any early check-in options.</li>
            <li>Check-Out. Check-Out Time is usually 10AM, but please review your check-in instructions for any late check-out options.</li>
            <li>Payment Processing. Payments of the fees and other charges set forth on the Booking Summary shall be processed by RedAwning as part of the Services. RedAwning generally charges 100% of the total Booking to hold your reservation.</li>
            <li>Cleaning & Other Fees. We include all stay related fees in the Cleaning Fee line, which may include cleaning, property manager, resort, tourism and other stay related fees. All RedAwning properties are professionally cleaned after each stay. This also includes the RedAwning Damage Waiver, giving you $3000 of coverage in place of traditional damage deposits so you can have a carefree stay.</li>
            <li>Owner Grace Period. Owner may cancel a Booking during the one business day period immediately following Guest's submittal of the Booking through the Services. This one business day grace period is intended to allow Owners to talk directly and confirm any details with Guests, as well as to address any calendar issues. The vast majority of reservations are accepted without issue.</li>
            <li>Payments & Cancellations: Cancellations are subject to the Cancellation Policy stated for each reservation. Some properties offer Free Cancellation until a set number of days prior to stay. Other properties have stricter policies depending on the property and other factors related to each destination. The cancellation policy for each property is stated at the time of booking and contained in the rental confirmation. Please check your Booking Summary for any property-specific or date-specific cancellation policies. Any change to a confirmed Booking must be approved by the Property Manager or Owner and is subject to a $75 change fee to cover RedAwning administrative costs. Other fees not originally included in the booking will incur a 13% processing fee.</li>
            <li>Chargebacks: Guest acknowledges and agrees that under the terms of this Agreement certain charges are nonrefundable upon satisfaction of the specified conditions. In the event Guest attempts a chargeback that RedAwning, upon reasonable investigation, concludes is in violation of this Agreement, RedAwning may in its sole discretion dispute such chargeback as a breach of this Agreement through all available means, including without limitation, by third-party debt collection services, in which event RedAwning shall be entitled to recover the cost of collection in addition to any other sums that may be due hereunder. Guest shall pay RedAwning an administration fee of $250 per chargeback, to be charged to Guest's credit card on file with RedAwning, for each chargeback submitted by Guest, to cover the cost incurred by RedAwning in the chargeback process. The administration fee is payable regardless of the chargeback outcome.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Late Departure</h2>
        <p>Guest agrees there shall be no holding over or late departure without prior approval. Any unauthorized holding over by Guest shall be subject to a charge of 1 and 1/2 times the daily prorated rent ("Holdover Rate"), plus any additional damages incurred including, but not limited to, the cost of alternative housing for other guests displaced by Guest's holding over.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Extra Cleaning</h2>
        <p>If the condition of the Property following the rental term requires extra cleaning beyond such standard level, or if Guest at any time requests additional cleaning services, Guest shall be solely responsible for the cost of such cleaning, and Guest hereby authorizes and directs RedAwning to affirmatively charge or debit, as the case may be, such amounts from Guest's charge or debit account on file with RedAwning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. No refund</h2>
        <p>No refund shall be given for cancellations due to poor snow conditions, severe weather, road closures, traffic delays, early departures, or illness or injury. RedAwning offers a Travel Insurance option that would cover some of these reasons for cancellation. Please contact our reservations department for information about this option.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Utilities/Telephone</h2>
        <p>Owner is to pay for all utilities, driveway snow removal (if applicable) and hot tub maintenance (if applicable), except long distance telephone charges. Guest may use the telephone for local calls only and should use a credit card or call collect to make any long distance calls. Guest agrees to pay for all long distance telephone charges during their stay and acknowledges that these charges may be levied on their credit card up to two months after check out. Note that phone, Internet, cable, and satellite connections, where available, cannot always be guaranteed, especially in mountain locations, and no refund will be given if they are not functional.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Smoking</h2>
        <p>All Properties are smoke free. No smoking is allowed inside the home, or within ten feet of any structure at the Property, including any garages and sheds. If evidence of smoking is found, Guest will be charged an additional cleaning fee of at least $500 to clean the carpet, upholstery, and drapery.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Occupancy</h2>
        <p>Occupancy may not exceed the number of people included in Guest's Booking. Occupancy calculation includes infants and children. Occupancy also includes any and all guests who visit the property, and no parties or other gatherings which exceed the Occupancy limit shall occur without prior approval of the Owner.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>9. Children</h2>
        <p>Guest agrees to supervise children at all times while using the Property, and to take necessary precautions with children who may wet their beds including utilizing plastic protection sheets or "Pull Ups". Costs to replace mattresses or linens damaged by bed wetting will be charged to the credit card on file. Note: Hot Tubs are not a safe environment for children under 12 at any time. Children must be supervised at all times while using a hot tub or pool.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>10. Pets</h2>
        <p>If the selected Property does not allow Pets, then no pets are allowed inside the home or any other structure at the Property, including any garages or sheds. If evidence of pets is found at a Property which does not allow pets, Guest will be charged an additional cleaning fee of at least $500 to clean the carpet, upholstery, and drapery.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>11. Allergies</h2>
        <p>Guest agrees that they are not entitled to a refund for any allergic reactions from any member of their party due to pollen, animals or environmental conditions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>12. Damage Waiver</h2>
        <p>As a convenience and benefit to you for booking through RedAwning, Owner hereby agrees to waive and release you from claims for damage, loss or injury ("Unintentional Damage") to the Property interior caused by the unintentional, non-breaching acts or omissions of you or others under your Booking that occurs during your stay. The foregoing is a limited waiver that is strictly conditioned on, and subject to, compliance with the following:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Reporting. You must report the Unintentional Damage to Owner or RedAwning promptly upon occurrence and in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours from the end of your Booking. Failure to timely report the Unintentional Damage as required will automatically void the waiver, in which event you will be liable for the entire repair or replacement cost of the Unintentional Damage.</li>
            <li>Waiver Cap. The actual repair or replacement cost of Unintentional Damage covered by this waiver is limited to, and cannot exceed, three thousand dollars ($3,000) (the "Waiver Cap"). Any repair or replacement costs exceeding the Waiver Cap shall be and remain your sole liability and obligation to pay and perform.</li>
            <li>Intentional Damage and Breach. Damage that you or others under your Booking (1) intentionally cause, (2) cause by conduct that is in breach of your obligations under this Agreement and/or the Booking Summary, or (3) cause due to the removal of any item(s) of personal property or fixtures from the Property (together "Intentional Damage") is not waived under this Section 12, but shall be and remain your sole liability and obligation to pay and perform.</li>
            <li>Payment Authorization. You hereby authorize RedAwning to charge your credit card on file with RedAwning for the cost of repair or replacement (1) for any Unintentional Damage exceeding the Waiver Cap; and (2) for all Intentional Damage.</li>
            <li>You acknowledge and agree that Owner's waiver under this Section 12 is an Owner-provided courtesy and not an insurance policy or a substitute for an insurance policy.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>13. Property Complaints</h2>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>If, on arrival, Guest does not feel the Property has been fairly and accurately represented on the property information page or there is some other issue with the Property, Guest must notify RedAwning within 12 hours of arrival and provide a reasonably accurate description of the non-conforming condition(s). Upon receipt of such notice, and if Owner is unwilling or unable to resolve the issue, RedAwning shall undertake good faith efforts to obtain what RedAwning concludes in its sole reasonable discretion is reasonably appropriate relief for Guest, including by way of example only, sourcing services required to remedy the Property's non-conforming condition, obtaining a rental fee discount from Owner, or locating alternative local accommodations having features that RedAwning reasonably concludes match or exceed those offered by the Property as originally represented.</li>
            <li>Guest must promptly report to RedAwning all other complaints or obvious damage to the Property caused by previous guests. Owner, either directly or through its third-party agent, shall make good faith efforts to promptly remedy the condition(s) at issue.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>14. Property Unavailability</h2>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>In the event a Property subject to a Booking becomes unavailable due to hurricane, avalanche, pandemic, government order or action, or other event preventing access to the Property and immediate surrounding area, RedAwning shall cancel the Booking and issue Guest a credit for a future stay. Guest agrees that no refund will be issued or due if such cancellation by Guest or RedAwning occurs at a time when Guest is no longer eligible for a refund under the cancellation policy agreed to by Guest as part of the Booking.</li>
            <li>In the event a Property subject to a Booking is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or otherwise becomes unavailable for use by Guest for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation, changes in rental prices and/or policies, at any time prior to the Check-In date, RedAwning shall promptly undertake commercially reasonable efforts to source an alternative property with characteristics that RedAwning deems to be reasonably similar to the Property for use by Guest pursuant to the terms of the Booking and such additional or other terms as may apply to such alternative property. In the event (a) an alternative property cannot be located or secured for any reason, including without limitation, inventory scarcity, low vacancy rates and other restrictions or limitations, or (b) Guest rejects the alternative property offered by RedAwning, RedAwning may elect in its sole discretion to cancel the Booking, effective immediately upon written notice to Guest, and refund any payments billed to and collected from Guest as of the date of notice, and upon payment of such refund, RedAwning and Owner shall each have no other or additional liability or obligation owing to Guest of any kind, which liability and obligations are hereby (i) disclaimed by RedAwning and Owner, and (ii) expressly waived and released by Guest notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of California, which provides that "[a] general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</li>
