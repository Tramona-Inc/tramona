      "Stylish Adobe. Home Base for Terlingua Adventures. Quiet, Comfortable and Convenient.\n•\tRelaxing Adobe Home w/ Large Covered Porch\n•\tOpen Kitchen, Dining, Living Room\n•\tExcellent Chisos Mountain Views \n•\tJust 1/2 Mile from the Ghost Town  \n•\tFire Ring for Campfires & S’moresThe SpaceWhen visiting the Big Bend, it helps to have a quiet, comfortable, and convenient home base. Pat O’s Place is exactly that. Pat built his Terlingua home as a place to relax and enjoy. He would be proud to now share his place with you.\n\nPat O’s Place is a quiet adobe home, lovingly decorated and well furnished, just outside of the world famous Terlingua Ghost Town. It is just remote enough to be quiet and peaceful, but close enough to walk to the Ghost Town. The seclusion of the secure adobe home and the tranquility of the spacious porch with views of the Chisos Mountains provide the quiet needed to forget about the pressures and stresses of daily life. The usual noise and distractions are silenced by the surrounding desert. This is a place to reconnect with what really matters.\n\nRelax in comfort inside or out. Inside, the spacious open floor plan is designed for time together. With a full kitchen, dining area, comfortable living space, large private bathroom, and a spacious bedroom with partial wall, the home will sleep four. The bedroom has a queen-size bed. The living room has a large leather sofa that fold out to a queen-size bed. Outside, the large covered patio has space for outdoor dining or relaxing in the ample shade while enjoying mountain views and cooling breezes.  The fire ring is the perfect spot for campfire, ghost stories, and making s’mores.\n\nEnjoy the convenience of being close to the Ghost Town, Big Bend National Park, the Rio Grande River, and Big Bend Ranch State Park. From the house to the heart of the Ghost Town, it is just over a half mile walk, ride, or drive. Driving to other area attractions is convenient with the house just over a half mile to FM 170. One mile to Desert Sports, two miles to Rio Aviation, four miles to La Kiva Bar & Grill, five miles to Far Flung and Big Bend River Tours, five and a half miles to Hwy 118, six miles to Big Bend Stables, and just eight miles to the western entrance to Big Bend National Park.\n\nThanks for letting us tell you about Pat O’s Place. Now, come and experience it for yourself. After you do, we suspect that you will want to tell your friends. That is exactly how Pat would have wanted it. This was his special place. It can now be your place to enjoy and remember.InteractionWe manage several properties and live a few miles away. We are available by phone, text, email, or messages through Airbnb.

      'Javelina Hideout: Off-grid rustic modern home with amazing views and solitude.\n• Rustic modern home with separate bunkhouse\n• Solar powered and eco-friendly\n• 1000 sq ft of covered outdoor porch designed for relaxation\n• Expansive mountain views with solitude\n• Wood burning and gas fire pitsThe SpaceIMPORTANT DISCLOSURE. PLEASE READ BEFORE BOOKING:\nRefer to the "Off-Grid" section below for more information regarding power considerations in the summer and on cloudy days.\n\nJavelina Hideout is a rustic modern desert home located on 10 acres with expansive views. JH is an eco-friendly, off-grid home with rainwater harvesting and blends in beautifully with the stunning desert scenery. It is thoughtfully and sustainably designed to maximize comfort and enjoyment while minimizing the environmental impact. Please read through the entire listing to avoid any confusion or disappointment.\n\n-MAIN HOUSE-\nThe main house features a full kitchen, open concept dining and living area, a private bathroom, and the primary bedroom. The kitchen is equipped with an oven, gas range, and a full-sized refrigerator, but there is no dishwasher or microwave. Pots, pans and dishware are provided. A French Press and pour over coffee maker are provided. The house is cooled by a mini split air conditioner in the primary bedroom and heated with wall heaters. The bedroom features a king memory foam mattress, ceiling fan, a large east facing window for watching the sunrise from bed, high south facing windows for mountain views. There is a comfortable rollaway TwinXL bed that can be used in the living room.\n \n-BUNKHOUSE-\nTwinXL bunk beds equipped with their own reading lamp and USB outlets are in the freestanding bunk house.  The bunkhouse is available on all reservations at no additional charge. Please let us know if you plan to use this additional space.  It is ideal for guests wanting solitude away from the main house. It has a window mounted air conditioner and a propane wall heater. An outdoor sink is provided for convenience. Bunk house guests can access the bathroom in the main house via an exterior door.\n\n-OUTDOOR SPACE-\nWe provide a 1000 square foot covered porch with comfortable seating and dining areas amidst a serene view.  Relax at the sunset bar with a beverage in hand, or swing in the hanging egg chairs while watching the shadows dance across the mesa and surrounding mountains.  We provide both a gas cooking grill (we provide the gas) and a charcoal grill (you provide the charcoal).

Please conserve water with diligence.  We suggest limiting showers to 3 minutes.  This house is powered entirely by the sun with battery storage. Please do not bring or use any electrical appliances that heat up such as a blow dryer, curling iron, coffee maker, crock pot etc. Be mindful of power use on cloudy days that inhibit solar performance. The AC’s in the main and bunk house are set to turn off when the batteries drop below 48V to ensure enough power for the fridge and water pump (AC’s will turn back on when the sun has charged to approximately 52 V).  Guests must be sensible about how and when they use the air conditioner. An instruction guide with summertime tips is provided at the rental.\n \n-ADDITIONAL CAMPERS-\nDo you have more friends that want to join in your adventures?  Campsites are available upon special request. Campers are required to bring their own tents, all their own bedding (sleeping pads & bags, pillows, blankets, bath linens, etc).   Additional $25 cleaning fee applies and there will be an additional charge of $10 per person per night for tent camping to help cover the cost of additional water usage.InteractionWe manage several properties and live a few miles away.

Enjoy the well-appointed kitchen with lots of storage or relax in the living room. Sit down at the dining table and enjoy eating, talking or playing a game with family and friends.\n\nTexas Home Sweet Home was originally built in 1975 and was subsequently gutted (other than the adobe walls) and rebuilt by a builder and his son in 2001. The builder had a love for the natural rocks (including petrified wood) from the Terlingua area and incorporated them into the beautiful rock wall and rock pillars that grace the house, as well as the front stone porch (look for the fossils). The house is decorated with Texas Flair.\n\nThe house features two large bedrooms, each with a king size bed. The kitchen is well stocked with pots and pans, standard kitchen wares, fridge, dishwasher, gas oven and range, microwave, blender, slow cooker, and more. The dining room has a large table that is great not only for meals, but for playing cards or the many games that the owners have provided. In the living room, you will find a gas fired fireplace (gas logs) and a smart TV for streaming using the basic free option or your subscriptions. The two bathrooms are more than ample with the main bath featuring a tub/shower as well as washer and dryer.\n\nOutside is a Texas Sized front rock porch that you will be sure to enjoy. Sit out on the rocking chairs and relax, or set up the picnic table and enjoy a meal outdoors, gather around the firepit and tell stories, or star gaze, or just take in the views of the surrounding mountains.\n\nBring your dogs. Texas Home has a fenced yard with shade and pet friendly interior. Two dogs maximum. A pet fee of $200 will be charged.\n\nThe word Texas comes from the Caddo Indian word teyshas meaning friend.

      "Terlingua Ranch Retreat: Solitude in Natural Harmony. 90 acres near Big Bend National Park.\n•\tAmazing 360-degree Mountain Views\n•\tSolar and Wind Powered Home\n•\tScreened Porch & Covered Porch\n•\tBooks, Games, Puzzles and MoreThe SpaceIMPORTANT DISCLOSURES. PLEASE READ BEFORE BOOKING:\n\nLIMITED AIRCONDITIONING:  \n-Cooling is provided by an evaporative cooler OR two small window unit ACs. The air-conditioners are only intended for use during days with full sun, while the sun is high. They can be run at other times IF the gas-powered generator is also running. Guests expecting inside summertime temps in the low 70’s or wanting to run the AC constantly should consider a different property. We would be happy to recommend other lodging options.  \nSOLAR-POWERED HOME: \n-No electronic devices other than those provided or chargers for phones and consumer electronics. \n-Absolutely no electric device with heating elements of any type. \n-If you rely on medically necessary electronics, we would be happy to recommend a different property.\n\nThis cozy one-bedroom vacation retreat located on 90 acres offers unparalleled 360 degree views, quiet, and comfort in a remote setting. No nearby lights to interrupt the starlit sky of the Big Bend. Sleeps two people in upstairs bedroom queen, plus a twin/daybed with a high-density foam mattress. The nearest house is a half mile away. You can go weeks without a passing car.\n\nHouse is light and modern, with bamboo floors, tile, and modern ceiling fans. The retreat is oriented so that at any time of the day, one of the two porches is in the shade. One is screened and the other open.\n\nThis is a great vacation rental. An escape from everyday life with a beautiful view of Nine Point Mesa to the north, Jack Eden Mesa to the northeast and Corazones Peaks to the south. The property is true to its desert climate, with dozens of species of cacti, along with ocotillo, yucca, and many varieties of prickly pear, strawberry pitaya, and rainbow cactus in abundance. In addition, bluebonnets, the Texas state flower, and resurrection ferns are found on the 90 acres. The property provides ample opportunities for watching birds and wildlife. We see foxes and deer regularly, and at night frequently hear coyotes howling in the distance.\n\nTo explore West Texas, the house is 30 miles from the Big Bend National Park gate; 23 miles to Study Butte/Terlingua ghost town and 35 miles to the famed Lajitas Resort.\n\nThe house is located three-quarter mile along a dirt road from the main ranch paved road, and the dirt road takes you over a rise so that traffic on the paved road is not visible or audible. All vehicles can make the short trip (but as always in this part of the world, have a spare tire just in case).\n\nThe property's solar and wind energy powers the lights, fans, appliances, and the radio/CD player, while propane gas powers the stove, wall heaters and hot water heater. The modern and eco-friendly separator toilet uses zero water. It separates liquid waste from solid and collects the solid wasted for composting. \n\nTo back-up the solar and wind power, there is a very quiet gas-powered generator. This will recharge the batteries if needed and will power the window air conditioners in the hottest months. \n\nThank you for understanding that there is a burn moratorium in Terlingua Ranch, and no campfires are allowed due to dry climate fire danger and fragility of desert vegetation.\n\nOne note of caution: the stairs to the upstairs bedroom are steeper than normal and may not be the suitable for those who have difficulty managing stairsInteractionWe manage several properties and live a few miles away. We are available by phone, text, email, or messages through Airbnb. We are typically only on site for cleaning or maintenance issues.",

      "Corazones Draw Ranch: Spacious Ranch House PLUS a Casita. 400 acres of Desert Wildlands.The SpaceEXTRA FEES MAY APPLY. These might not appear in quote and will be added if applicable.\n     Extra Space Cleaning Fee: $85 per stay if the Casita is used. \n     The Casita is required for groups larger than seven or optional for any groups wanting extra space.\n\nCorazones Draw Ranch is a 400 acre wildlife ranch with two homes and lots of acreage to roam and explore. Dozens of Mule Deer visit the wildlife water guzzler and feeding station behind the main house daily. This listing is for the ENTIRE Ranch, including both homes.\n \nGroups are welcome. Occupancy inside the Ranch House is limited to seven. The Adobe Casita can house four more. There is a nominal cleaning fee for use of the Casita. \n\nRANCH HOUSE DETAILS: The Ranch House has a fully stocked kitchen with a dining area, comfortable living room, an enclosed porch with a bar, a private game shack, two full bathrooms, and three bedrooms. All the beds and linens are brand new as of November 2018. The master bedroom has a king bed and a private bathroom. The second bedroom has a queen bed and a twin bed. The third bedroom has a queen bed. \n\nThe enclosed Bar Porch at the Ranch House is an enclosed porch with three screened archways for fresh air. With a bar and a variety of seating options, the porch is a great place to hang out, relax, share meals, or drinks at any time and in virtually any weather.\n\nThe private Game Shack at the Ranch House is detached but connected by a semi-enclosed breezeway. This rustic outbuilding has two windows overlooking a feeding and watering area for native wildlife. On most mornings and evenings, guests can watch mule deer and javelina come in for a drink or to feed. It is common to see herds of well over a dozen at a time. Tables, chairs, a small collection of games, and a large drink cooler also make this a great place to hang out. Since it is separated from the main house, it is a great place for night owls to get a little rowdy without worrying about disturbing friends or family sleeping in the main house.\n\nADOBE CASITA DETAILS: This one-bedroom guest house is a classic southwestern adobe home with a fully stocked kitchenette, open living space with dining area and living room, a full bathroom, one bedroom with two queen beds, and a Spanish style covered patio with mountain views framed by adobe archways. The Casita sits on a hilltop, a half mile from the Ranch House, with breathtaking views of Corazones Draw Ranch and the surrounding mountains.\n\nCOVERED PARKING: There is covered parking for up to three vehicles and lots of room for additional vehicle or trailers.\n\nEXCLUSIVE RANCH ACCESS: As renters of Corazones Draw Ranch, you will have exclusive access to over 400 acres of private Chihuahuan Desert wilderness. The property includes rugged hills, canyons, wet weather creeks, including the scenic Corazones Draw, and abundant wildlife. Wild game has been protected and provided with year-round water and feed on this property for several years. Deer and Javelina are commonly seen near the house. Aoudad Sheep are occasionally seen in the rugged hills and ridges. Hunting is not allowed.\n\nINQUIRIES WELCOME: Call or email us with any questions. We are eager to know how you would like to use the Ranch and we are committed to exceeding your expectations.NeighborhoodTERLINGUA RANCH: Located between Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State Park and including much of the town of Terlingua, Terlingua Ranch is a private subdivision of over 190,000 acres, divided into 9,500 tracts owned by about 5,000 individuals and crisscrossed by 1,100 miles of dirt and rock roads. Tracts range from five acres to several hundred acres. It is some of the most rugged and scenic land in Texas. \n\nBack in the 1960’s, the Ghost Town and much of what later became “Terlingua Ranch” was owned by racing legend and car designer extraordinaire, Carol Shelby and some of his friends. The decided to promote the area by holding a chili cook-off in the then abandoned Ghost Town. That little stunt of a cook-off grew into CASI (Chili Appreciation Society International) which now hosts nearly 500 chili cook-offs around the nation and internationally, all leading up the championship cook-off every year in Terlingua. Shelby and friends later subdivided the Ranch and started selling it off to hunters and rugged naturalists. Over the decades, the area was reborn and an eclectic community of nature lovers, artists, musicians, adventurers, and folks just wanting to escape from “civilization” has grown and started to resettle this rough country. \n\nPeople have come and gone. New buildings have risen while others have fallen, Dreams have been realized and others crushed. Through it all, the land remains. The harsh desert and vast openness encourages positive development and slowly swallows up and recovers from past abuses. The old cinnabar mine sites and ranching outposts persist as relics and ghost towns, some redeveloped, some carefully preserved, and others dissolving back into the desert. Abandoned dreams eventually become points of interests for those of us that stumble upon them decades later. Terlingua Ranch is a bizarre mix of old and new, good and bad, growth and decline, all completely unregulated. Modern homes with high values and stunning designs stand beside dilapidated do-it-yourself mistakes and abandoned ruins of the 1800’s and early 1900’s. \n\nThe landscape is even more varied than the people and the structures. Rugged mountains, deep canyons, wild arroyos, dry and wet creeks, peaceful valleys, breathtaking badlands, moonscape like mud flats, the remains of ancient volcanoes, and fossilized ancient seabeds. All of it nurturing a vast array of plant life and wildlife. Around every corner and over every hill lies new and unexpected surprises. \n\nThe Ranch is now home to a few hundred hardy souls. It is also dotted with a diverse array of vacation rental lodging options and campsites. Like the diverse land, they range in quality, style, value, and price. A few are amazing dream destinations. Some are good places to sleep. Others are the stuff of nightmares. (We don’t manage any in the nightmare category.)\n\nBig Bend Vacation Rentals started out in 2007 and initially managed three of the first four vacation rentals in the Terlingua and Terlingua Ranch area. We now manage dozens out of a couple of hundred options. We represent dozens of property owners and have hosted tens of thousands of guests. You can trust us as managers, and you can rely on the properties that we manage. We have become very selective about the properties and the property owners that we add to our portfolio.

This has to be added afterwards.\n\nWATER:\nNon-Potable. This property is on a water well. It is not certified as potable. Bottled water is provided for drinking and cooking.

The water from the well is fine for washing dishes, showering, laundry.Getting AroundCorazone Draw Ranch is about a 45 minute drive to the west entrance of the Big Bend National Park.",

      "Crystal Valley Cabin: Modern-rustic cabin on Terlingua Ranch. Outdoor tub. Seven miles from pool.The SpaceCrystal Valley is newly renovated in 2017 for vacation rentals. Relax inside or outside and enjoy the mountain views.\n\nCrystal Valley Cabin on Terlingua Ranch is the ideal home base for your visit to the Big Bend Region. Modern-rustic design will set the perfect tone for your Big Bend adventure. The convenient location and easy access will allow you to focus on your vacation instead of stressing about vehicle access or long drives down questionable roads. The surprising seclusion will provide ample privacy and solitude. But, let’s not kid ourselves, the best thing about Crystal Valley Cabin is the chance to take a bath in an antique clawfoot tub under the Texas night sky. Do you even need to read the rest of this property description?\n \nStill reading? Okay, some more details would help. Besides, there’s much more that we want brag about. After soaking in the tub while watching meteors fall, satellites fly overhead, and the Milky Way shine, you’ll probably want to relax around the campfire with a refreshing beverage, maybe even a sausage on a stick, or better yet, some s’mores. Whatever you eat and drink around the fire ring, will go well with campfire stories, some songs, or whatever else you want to do. Nobody is watching. It’s just you and your partner, or family and friends, under a starry Texas sky. You’re probably ready to stop reading now and just book your stay already. Fine with us, but we really should tell you a bit more.\n \nThe ramada (no, not the cookie-cutter-hotel-chain, but a freestanding shade structure) beside the outdoor tub is the perfect spot to enjoy the cooling breezes on sunny afternoons, or to share a meal while admiring the mountain views. There’s also an outdoor shower and sink there. The porches at Crystal Valley Cabin are also great places to relax in the shade while catching a breeze and marveling at the views.\n \nEventually, you may want to come inside. We recommend it anyway. You don’t have to and we won’t blame you if spend all your time outside. However, the bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen, and living room are pretty darn great, and useful, if you’re into that sort of thing. The master bedroom has a really comfortable queen bed with high quality linens and a bedframe that was hand built from a persimmon tree. The bedroom windows have a stunning view of East Corazón Peak. The second bedroom, with a view of Jack Eden Mesa, has a queen bed and a twin bed. The bathroom has a spacious tile shower (for those that prefer bathing inside). The large kitchen has ample counter and cabinet space, glass top electric range and oven, microwave, coffee maker, large fridge, bar counter, and a large picture window with a fantastic view of Jack Eden Mesa and crystal valley. The living room ties it all together with large leather easy chairs, a leather sofa, wood burning stove, large ceiling fans, and a breathtaking view of East Corazón Peak. There is even a branch from the property owner’s Madrone Tree hanging on the wall, just because it’s cool. If you need a place where you can focus on a little work (yeah right!), do some writing, or just get online without too many distractions, there is built in desk in the corner of the living room. Wi-Fi internet access is available throughout the home and on the porches.\n \nOf course, after bathing under the stars, telling stories by the campfire, sleeping in the comfy beds, and relaxing in the living room, then logging onto social media to share your fun with all your friends, you might want to check out some of the amazing things to see and do in the area. Terlingua Ranch Lodge is just ten minutes away with the Bad Rabbit Café for great food, cold drinks, and frequent live music. The lodge office is also the place to register if you want to explore the Christmas Mountain conservation area. Terlingua and the western entrance to Big Bend National Park is a short 35-minute drive away. Adventure outfitters located in Terlingua offer river trips, horseback riding, jeep tours, ATV adventures, Jeep rentals, guided hikes, and mountain bike rentals. The famous Terlingua Ghost Town is just 40 minutes away. Both the Ghost Town and the Terlingua/Study Butte area offer shopping, dining, drinking, live music, art galleries, and more. Heading another 15 minutes west from Terlingua will take you to Lajitas for more upscale dining options, a few great shops, and the chance to meet Clay Henry, the beer drinking goat that happens to be the mayor. Big Bend Ranch State Park (the national park’s wild and rugged cousin) is right there as well. Stop in at the Barton Warnock center just before you get to Lajitas for an overview of the park, museum, and a terrific book shop. Alpine, Fort Davis, Marfa, and the McDonald Observatory are also within easy day trip range.\n \nCome on down. Soak in our tub under the stars. Enjoy the Big Bend. Do as much or as little as you like. You’ll have a memorable time and will likely start planning your return trip before you even leave. That’s great. We’ll love to have come back over and over. In fact, that’s how the owners of Crystal Valley Cabin became the owners. They came out here so often and enjoyed staying at other Big Bend Vacation Rental properties so much that they eventually decide to buy and remodel their own. They were very deliberate and considerate in incorporating all the thing they enjoyed the most at other rentals, plus adding extra touches to create the ultimate Big Bend vacation home base. Now, they’re eager to share it all with you.NeighborhoodTERLINGUA RANCH: Located between Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State Park and including much of the town of Terlingua, Terlingua Ranch is a private subdivision of over 190,000 acres, divided into 9,500 tracts owned by about 5,000 individuals and crisscrossed by 1,100 miles of dirt and rock roads. Tracts range from five acres to several hundred acres. It is some of the most rugged and scenic land in Texas. \n\nBack in the 1960’s, the Ghost Town and much of what later became “Terlingua Ranch” was owned by racing legend and car designer extraordinaire, Carol Shelby and some of his friends. The decided to promote the area by holding a chili cook-off in the then abandoned Ghost Town. That little stunt of a cook-off grew into CASI (Chili Appreciation Society International) which now hosts nearly 500 chili cook-offs around the nation and internationally, all leading up the championship cook-off every year in Terlingua. Shelby and friends later subdivided the Ranch and started selling it off to hunters and rugged naturalists. Over the decades, the area was reborn and an eclectic community of nature lovers, artists, musicians, adventurers, and folks just wanting to escape from “civilization” has grown and started to resettle this rough country. \n\nPeople have come and gone. New buildings have risen while others have fallen, Dreams have been realized and others crushed. Through it all, the land remains. The harsh desert and vast openness encourages positive development and slowly swallows up and recovers from past abuses. The old cinnabar mine sites and ranching outposts persist as relics and ghost towns, some redeveloped, some carefully preserved, and others dissolving back into the desert. Abandoned dreams eventually become points of interests for those of us that stumble upon them decades later. Terlingua Ranch is a bizarre mix of old and new, good and bad, growth and decline, all completely unregulated. Modern homes with high values and stunning designs stand beside dilapidated do-it-yourself mistakes and abandoned ruins of the 1800’s and early 1900’s. \n\nThe landscape is even more varied than the people and the structures. Rugged mountains, deep canyons, wild arroyos, dry and wet creeks, peaceful valleys, breathtaking badlands, moonscape like mud flats, the remains of ancient volcanoes, and fossilized ancient seabeds. All of it nurturing a vast array of plant life and wildlife. Around every corner and over every hill lies new and unexpected surprises. \n\nThe Ranch is now home to a few hundred hardy souls. It is also dotted with a diverse array of vacation rental lodging options and campsites. Like the diverse land, they range in quality, style, value, and price. A few are amazing dream destinations. Some are good places to sleep. Others are the stuff of nightmares. (We don’t manage any in the nightmare category.)\n\nBig Bend Vacation Rentals started out in 2007 and initially managed three of the first four vacation rentals in the Terlingua and Terlingua Ranch area. We now manage dozens out of a couple of hundred options. We represent dozens of property owners and have hosted tens of thousands of guests. You can trust us as managers, and you can rely on the properties that we manage. We have become very selective about the properties and the property owners that we add to our portfolio.",

      "Desert Aura: Classic adobe with detached guest house.The SpaceDesert Aura is a classic adobe home with a detached guesthouse.  Breathtaking Views of the Chisos Mountains and Terlingua Ranch.\n\nDesert Aura offers unique character and charm that can’t be duplicated with modern construction. Lovingly built by hand, over many years, by the family that still proudly calls it home. Thick adobe walls, stone floors, and surrounded by stone patios with unparalleled views of the Chisos Mountains in Big Bend National Park, Desert Aura lives up to its name by emanating the very character of Terlingua Ranch and the Big Bend. You will feel like you are part of the desert as you live like a true local here on Terlingua Ranch.\n \nNot many vacation rentals come with their own guest house.  The main house will sleep up to four, with two queen beds. The detached guesthouse, with a queen bed, private bathroom, and kitchenette, is automatically included in all rentals for extra space and added privacy.\n \nThe two homes are separated by a shaded breezeway that is an ideal place to relax outside or even share a meal. Views from the breezeway and the other patio areas are simply breathtaking. Wildlife is abundant and water and birdseed is provided for the birds. Please don’t straighten out the bent “shepherd’s hook” bird feeder holder. The home’s matriarch cherishes that bent hook as a reminder of the time that a Mexican Black Bear dropped by to sample the bird seed and bent the hook. Don’t worry though, the bears are extremely uncommon here. They are very timid and have never threatened anyone in the area. Mexican Black Bears are among the smallest of the bear species in North America, rarely exceeding five feet in length or three feet in height at the shoulder.\n\nThe main house has an open floorplan with a living room, dining room, and kitchen all open to each other. Perfect for spending time together. There is also a semi-private den with a queen bed. The master bedroom has a comfortable queen bed and antique armoire. Neither bedroom in the main house has an entry door. The main bedroom is open to a hallway that extends to the room with the second bed. The bathroom with a large tiled shower and ample counter space is located between the bedroom and den and opens to both. There is even a utility room with a washer and dryer for use during your stay.\n \nThe guesthouse has a studio layout with a single room housing a queen bed, dining area, and kitchenette. There is also a private bathroom with a combination shower and tub. Stone floors and southwestern styling create a welcoming retreat. Thick adobe walls and separation from the main house provide guests with plenty of privacy during their stay.\n \nDesert Aura is located just two miles from Terlingua Ranch Lodge. The lodge also offers a great little restaurant, The Bad Rabbit Cafe, with frequent live entertainment. Guests can register at the lodge for access to the Christmas Mountain conservation area, a 9,270 acre reserve owned by the Texas State University System. Vehicle access along a narrow jeep trail is permitted for only one vehicle at a time. Hikers can park at the trailhead. \n\nBig Bend National Park, Terlingua, and the Terlingua Ghost Town are just a 40 minute drive away. Lajitas and Big Bend Ranch State Park are about an hour away. Adventure outfitters in Terlingua offer river trips in canoes or rafts, jeep tours, guided hikes, horseback tours, ATV tours, Jeep rentals, and mountain bike rentals. Terlingua, the Ghost Town, and Lajitas offer a variety of dining, drinking, and live music venues, plus shopping and art galleries.\n \nWhile here, live like a local. There are ample adventures to keep you busy and leave you exhausted, or just relax around Desert Aura to escape the stresses of “civilized” life.NeighborhoodTERLINGUA RANCH: Located between Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State Park and including much of the town of Terlingua, Terlingua Ranch is a private subdivision of over 190,000 acres, divided into 9,500 tracts owned by about 5,000 individuals and crisscrossed by 1,100 miles of dirt and rock roads.

      "Dos Corazones: Relax in luxury in this exquisite southwestern adobe home on Terlingua Ranch.\n•\tThe Most Luxurious Terlingua Rental \n•\tKitchen, Dining, Living Room & Den\n•\tEasy Access in All Weather Conditions  \n•\tExquisitely Designed and DecoratedThe SpaceNo Children Under 12\n\nDos Corazones is our most elegant rental.  The custom construction and unique decor are simply exquisite.  Photos do not do justice to this amazing home.\n\nBeautifully custom-built adobe home designed in an elegant and classic southwestern style and nestled at the base of the Corazones Mountains. Relax and escape from daily stresses while enjoying the grandest splendor and comfort available in the Big Bend.\n\nDos Corazones was designed in the tradition of a grand Chihuahuan hacienda. High ceilings, rich wood work, stucco adobe walls, artful stone masonry, and elegant tile floors make every room exquisite and inviting. Many architectural items, including doors, hardware, and fixtures, were salvaged from historic buildings in Mexico, South Africa and Morocco and artfully incorporated into this wonderfully designed home. The interior décor proudly features an extensive collection of folk art, baskets, and textiles that the owners collected from their world travels.\n\nThis home is incredibly spacious. There is plenty of room for your entire group to spend time together or for each to claim their own private space. The great room features a comfortable leather sofa and chairs and is the perfect place to relax and tell stories while enjoying expansive mountain views. The den offers a touch of seclusion and is a great place to relax with a good book. The spacious dining room is ideal for sharing meals or playing games. Speaking of meals, the expansive kitchen is a great place to prepare a gourmet meal or a simple snack.\n\nThere are several fireplaces in the house. However, no fires are allowed. The chimneys have all been permanently capped. There are candle stands and candles for your use in each fireplace.\n\nThere are two large bedrooms. Each one has its own luxurious bathroom and private patio. The master suite has a king bed, a private bathroom with a large shower, and private patio with views of Sombrero Peak and the Rosillos Mountains. The second bedroom has a queen bed and a full bed, a private bathroom with a large shower.  All mattresses are high quality memory foam purchased Sept 2017.\n\nOf course, you didn’t drive all this way to stay inside. That’s why Dos Corazones has six different flagstone patios for your enjoyment. The central courtyard features a peaceful water fountain and lots of greenery. The front porch features a built-in grill and a small outdoor dining area. The two back porches offer expansive views and plenty of space to stretch out. The private porches attached to each bathroom provide a more intimate setting with privacy walls and lots of greenery.\n \nThe owner, Gillian Hennessy, lives in the nearby guest house.  Feel free to introduce yourself and ask her questions about the home or area.  Otherwise, she may wave and say hello, but will keep to herself and respect your privacy.\n\nWant to see the stars at night? Well they are truly big and bright down here in the Big Bend Area. Our remoteness means there is virtually no light pollution to obscure the night sky. The Big Bend Region is recognized and celebrated for having the darkest night skies and best star gazing in the continental United States. Don’t forget to watch for the International Space Station and other orbiting satellites. They can often be spotted in the first hour or two after dusk or before dawn.\n\nVenture into Big Bend National Park or Big Bend Ranch State Park. Visit the Terlingua Ghost Town. Check out the Christmas Mountains. Take a horseback ride or go on a river trip. Check out the local cuisine at the Terlingua Ranch Bad Rabbit Café, in Terlingua/Study Butte, the Terlingua Ghost town, or Lajitas. You won’t be disappointed. There is often live music at the famous La Kiva Bar and Grill, the Starlight Theatre, High Sierra Bar and Grill, or the Terlingua Ranch Bad Rabbit Café. There are so many things to see and do you won’t be able to see or do it all.\n\nStay as busy as you like or just relax and unwind. When you leave Dos Corazones you can be as rested and refreshed, or as exhausted and inspired, as you like. Don’t worry about fitting everything into one trip. We’ll be glad to welcome you back again and again.NeighborhoodTERLINGUA RANCH: Located between Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State Park and including much of the town of Terlingua, Terlingua Ranch is a private subdivision of over 190,000 acres, divided into 9,500 tracts owned by about 5,000 individuals and crisscrossed by 1,100 miles of dirt and rock roads. Tracts range from five acres to several hundred acres. It is some of the most rugged and scenic land in Texas. \n\nBack in the 1960’s, the Ghost Town and much of what later became “Terlingua Ranch” was owned by racing legend and car designer extraordinaire, Carol Shelby and some of his friends. The decided to promote the area by holding a chili cook-off in the then abandoned Ghost Town. That little stunt of a cook-off grew into CASI (Chili Appreciation Society International) which now hosts nearly 500 chili cook-offs around the nation and internationally, all leading up the championship cook-off every year in Terlingua. Shelby and friends later subdivided the Ranch and started selling it off to hunters and rugged naturalists. Over the decades, the area was reborn and an eclectic community of nature lovers, artists, musicians, adventurers, and folks just wanting to escape from “civilization” has grown and started to resettle this rough country. \n\nPeople have come and gone. New buildings have risen while others have fallen, Dreams have been realized and others crushed. Through it all, the land remains. The harsh desert and vast openness encourages positive development and slowly swallows up and recovers from past abuses. The old cinnabar mine sites and ranching outposts persist as relics and ghost towns, some redeveloped, some carefully preserved, and others dissolving back into the desert. Abandoned dreams eventually become points of interests for those of us that stumble upon them decades later. Terlingua Ranch is a bizarre mix of old and new, good and bad, growth and decline, all completely unregulated. Modern homes with high values and stunning designs stand beside dilapidated do-it-yourself mistakes and abandoned ruins of the 1800’s and early 1900’s. \n\nThe landscape is even more varied than the people and the structures. Rugged mountains, deep canyons, wild arroyos, dry and wet creeks, peaceful valleys, breathtaking badlands, moonscape like mud flats, the remains of ancient volcanoes, and fossilized ancient seabeds. All of it nurturing a vast array of plant life and wildlife. Around every corner and over every hill lies new and unexpected surprises. \n\nThe Ranch is now home to a few hundred hardy souls. It is also dotted with a diverse array of vacation rental lodging options and campsites. Like the diverse land, they range in quality, style, value, and price. A few are amazing dream destinations. Some are good places to sleep. Others are the stuff of nightmares. (We don’t manage any in the nightmare category.)\n\nBig Bend Vacation Rentals started out in 2007 and initially managed three of the first four vacation rentals in the Terlingua and Terlingua Ranch area. We now manage dozens out of a couple of hundred options. We represent dozens of property owners and have hosted tens of thousands of guests.

      "Fossil Knob Ridge Two: Relax in Style. Ultra-Modern Container Home Near Terlingua Ghost Town.\n\nUltra-Modern Shipping Container Home \nTwo King Beds and Large Picture Windows\nOverlooking Terlingua Ghost Town and BBNP\nSpacious Porch with Comfortable Seating\nClean and Modern near Dusty Ghost TownThe SpaceHigh Clearance Vehicle Recommended due to rough and rocky roads.\n\nBook your vacation at the ultimate modern vacation rentals in the rugged outback of the Big Bend region. In a land of endless mountain and desert vistas that is famed for ghost town ruins, rustic adobes, and Old West ranch homes, the Fossil Knob Ridge vacation rentals offer a unique contrast. The ultra-modern vacation rentals at Fossil Knob Ridge are contemporary homes built from recycled shipping containers. Yes, you read that right. These vacation rental homes are constructed from big metal boxes that were originally used for transporting cargo across the globe on trains and ocean freighters. The owner purchased them from a shipping company and converted them into contemporary and stylish living spaces. Don’t worry though, they are far more than just metal boxes with some furniture. Indeed, these homes offer the most neoteric lodging in the Terlingua area.\n \nFossil Knob Ridge Two is an ultra-modern home built from a forty-foot and a twenty-foot recycled shipping container joined together. The floorplan has an extremely efficient and space saving design while preserving a surprisingly spacious feel. It includes a large bedroom with a two king-size beds, a living and dining area, kitchenette, and full bathroom. The shaded patio offers additional living space for your comfort and enjoyment. Modern design, styling, and art are featured inside and out. Please view the photos for the best description.\n \nThis rental sleeps up to four guests on two king-sized beds.\n\nIf you have a larger group, or simply want more space, we recommend also booking Fossil Knob Ridge One. It is also built from two shipping containers, one forty-foot and one twenty-foot. It is close by but faces away to preserve privacy for both rentals. Both homes have privacy and their own unique views. Check out the Fossil Knob Ridge One listing for more info on that home. You are welcome to rent either home or both.\n \nBoth of the Fossil Knob Ridge Rentals are on the electric grid for reliable and ample electric power. Both are fully air-conditioned and heated and have modern electric appliances. Potable water is trucked in and stored in holding tanks for your use. There is plenty of water available but trucking it in is expensive. We ask that you conserve it, but not so much as to compromise your comfort.\n \nLocated just one-mile northwest of the world famous Terlingua Ghost Town and twenty miles northwest of the Chisos Mountains in Big Bend National Park. Fossil Knob Ridge overlooks the Ghost Town and has breathtaking mountain views, including the Chisos Mountains and into Mexico.\n \nRelax inside or on the shaded patio. Explore the fossil strewn 20-acre property. Drive or walk into the Ghost Town to explore the historic ruins, dine, drink, enjoy live music, or hang out with local and travelers from around the globe. If you play an instrument or sing, join in on an impromptu jam, session on the porch of the old trading post. Drive into Big Bend Nation Park or Big Bend Ranch State park for endless outdoor adventures. Book a river trip, jeep tour, horseback ride, mountain bike rental, guided hike, or guided hunt. Enjoy a controlled campfire. Marvel at the night skies. Watch the stunning sunrises and sunsets. Do as much or as little as you like. Then, come back again and do even more or even less.",

      "La Paloma Triste: Classic adobe vacation home. Minutes from Terlingua and Big Bend National Park.The SpaceStep back in time at this vintage Terlingua adobe. La Paloma Triste is an ideal escape from the madness of modern life. This is the quintessential Terlingua vacation home.\n\nLa Paloma Triste (The Sad Dove) is a classic adobe home at Willow Spring and just minutes from Terlingua with excellent views of the Chisos Mountains and Willow Mountain.  Built in the 80’s, with antique doors, windows, fixtures, and furnishings reclaimed from much older homes in Mexico and the Southwest, this cozy home blends modern conveniences with genuine rustic charm.  Whether relaxing by the wood burning stove or enjoying the views from the porch swing, you’ll feel as if you stepped back in time to the pioneer days of the Wild West.\n\nThere is plenty of room to relax with two bedrooms, a full kitchen, a large living room, one and a half bathrooms, a spacious porch and covered parking, not to mention forty private acres of pristine desert habitat. The main bedroom features a queen sized four poster bed, antique armoire, antique dresser and a private bath with a shower. The second bedroom has two walls full of windows with breathtaking views of the Chisos Mountains and nearby Bee Mountain. The living room has an antique wood burning stove (wood provided), rustic built-in shelves filled with artifacts and other items of local interests, and comfortable seating. The fully stocked kitchen has a new gas stove, antique sink, rustic shelving, and a classic pine and cedar table that was built by the owners. The large back porch has a porch swing for two with amazing views of the Chisos Mountains and Bee Mountain. The carport protects your vehicle from the west Texas sun and our infrequent storms.  \n\nOf course, the main attractions are outside. Take time to enjoy the solitude of the Chihuahuan desert and Willow Spring. The area around the house is landscaped with native plants, interesting rocks, and rusty pioneer artifacts that were collected over many years by the original owner. You will also want to visit Big Bend National Park, the Rio Grande River, Big Bend Ranch State Park, Terlingua Ghost Town, and our various restaurants and shops. If you don’t have time on this trip, you’re welcome to return again and again.\n\nThe views of the night sky are beyond simple description. The Big Bend region has the darkest nights (lowest light pollution) of anywhere in the continental US. \n\nAs the song says, “the stars at night are big and bright deep in the heart of Texas”. They’re even bigger and brighter here in the Bend. When the moon is out, you’ll be amazed at how bright and clear it shines. When the moon is not out, you’ll be stunned by the countless stars and the light and dark bands of the Milky Way. In the hour or two after sunset and before sunrise, you can often see the International Space Station and other satellites racing across the night sky. Shooting stars are visible throughout the year, especially during the Perseid and Geminid meteor showers.\n\nCheck out “VisitBigBend.com” for suggestions of things to do and see during your stay. Explore the parks, raft the river, go horseback riding, take scenic drives, go mountain biking, visit the ghost town, eat out, enjoy the local nightlife including live music at several small venues, watch the wildlife, or just relax on the porch with your favorite book. Return home exhausted and inspired from endless adventures or well-rested and refreshed from escaping the rush of modern life. The choices are all yours. Regardless of your plans, La Paloma Triste (The Sad Dove) is an ideal home away from home for your visit the Big Bend.",

Enjoy a guided horseback ride or jeep tour through the rugged west Texas landscape.\n\nWith so many options, you can return home as relaxed or exhausted as you choose. Either way, you'll “getaway” from everyday life and bring back countless memories.NeighborhoodTERLINGUA RANCH: Located between Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State Park and including much of the town of Terlingua, Terlingua Ranch is a private subdivision of over 190,000 acres, divided into 9,500 tracts owned by about 5,000 individuals and crisscrossed by 1,100 miles of dirt and rock roads. Tracts range from five acres to several hundred acres. It is some of the most rugged and scenic land in Texas. \n\nBack in the 1960’s, the Ghost Town and much of what later became “Terlingua Ranch” was owned by racing legend and car designer extraordinaire, Carol Shelby and some of his friends. The decided to promote the area by holding a chili cook-off in the then abandoned Ghost Town. That little stunt of a cook-off grew into CASI (Chili Appreciation Society International) which now hosts nearly 500 chili cook-offs around the nation and internationally, all leading up the championship cook-off every year in Terlingua. Shelby and friends later subdivided the Ranch and started selling it off to hunters and rugged naturalists. Over the decades, the area was reborn and an eclectic community of nature lovers, artists, musicians, adventurers, and folks just wanting to escape from “civilization” has grown and started to resettle this rough country. \n\nPeople have come and gone. New buildings have risen while others have fallen, Dreams have been realized and others crushed. Through it all, the land remains. The harsh desert and vast openness encourages positive development and slowly swallows up and recovers from past abuses. The old cinnabar mine sites and ranching outposts persist as relics and ghost towns, some redeveloped, some carefully preserved, and others dissolving back into the desert. Abandoned dreams eventually become points of interests for those of us that stumble upon them decades later. Terlingua Ranch is a bizarre mix of old and new, good and bad, growth and decline, all completely unregulated. Modern homes with high values and stunning designs stand beside dilapidated do-it-yourself mistakes and abandoned ruins of the 1800’s and early 1900’s. \n\nThe landscape is even more varied than the people and the structures. Rugged mountains, deep canyons, wild arroyos, dry and wet creeks, peaceful valleys, breathtaking badlands, moonscape like mud flats, the remains of ancient volcanoes, and fossilized ancient seabeds. All of it nurturing a vast array of plant life and wildlife. Around every corner and over every hill lies new and unexpected surprises. \n\nThe Ranch is now home to a few hundred hardy souls. It is also dotted with a diverse array of vacation rental lodging options and campsites. Like the diverse land, they range in quality, style, value, and price. A few are amazing dream destinations. Some are good places to sleep. Others are the stuff of nightmares. (We don’t manage any in the nightmare category.)\n\nBig Bend Vacation Rentals started out in 2007 and initially managed three of the first four vacation rentals in the Terlingua and Terlingua Ranch area. We now manage dozens out of a couple of hundred options. We represent dozens of property owners and have hosted tens of thousands of guests. You can trust us as managers, and you can rely on the properties that we manage. We have become very selective about the properties and the property owners that we add to our portfolio.InteractionWe manage several properties and live several miles away.

      "Casa Mariposa: Live Like a Local at this Restored Rock Ruin in the Historic Terlingua Ghost Town.\n•\tRestored Ruin with Spacious Outdoor Living\n•\tThis is Our Quintessential Ghost Town Rental\n•\tLocated in the Historic Ghost Town\n•\tKitchen, Bedroom and Cozy Room\n•\tFull Indoor Bathroom PLUS a semi-enclosed outdoor showerThe SpaceCasa Mariposa is tucked away on the Ghost Town hillside, surrounded by history. You will be a short trail walk away from all the Ghost Town has to offer: restaurants, art, shopping, and entertainment. This historic miners’ rock house has all the charm Ghost Town living has to offer. Conveniently located between the iconic Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State Park, Texas’s largest state park.\n \nSpend some time in this restored limestone ruin from the historic Terlingua mining days. Using the original footprint, the house was partly remade in the 1970s. The owners completed an additional restoration in the 1990s and have continued refurbishments recently.\n \nCasa Mariposa is equipped with a full kitchen, two bedrooms, and a full bathroom.  The outdoor living space is spacious and tranquil.  It is perfect for your morning coffee, outdoor dining, relaxing in the shade, admiring Terlingua’s incredible sunrises and sunsets, and star gazing. Relax with a campfire, and soak in the desert peace.\n \nThe 475 square foot interior has a full kitchen, 2 bedrooms, and a full bathroom. You will spend much of your time enjoying the breezy shade of the outdoor living area.  There is a brand new indoor bathroom with hot water, shower, sink, and flushing toilet. Outside, there is also a semi-enclosed bath house has a shower and sink and a quaint outhouse with Chisos Mountain views.\n \nThe Master Bedroom - You’ll find a comfortable queen size bed and plenty of space for all your belongings.  Large windows open out to the patio. Peruse the little collection of books of local interest. The master bedroom has its own entrance and shares a very thick rock wall with the kitchen and the Cozy Room. \n\nIt should be noted that there is not a connecting door between the main bedroom and the rest of the house. Guests need to going outside, on the covered patio, to move from one side of the house to the other. \n \nThe Cozy Bedroom - This simple hideaway behind the kitchen is my favorite room in the house, but it is tiny. The full-size futon just fits in the space.  There is beautiful ceiling of vigas and sotol, a saltillo tile floor, and a little nicho for your knick-knacks.  It maintains the tiny windows that were part of the original design of the miners’ home.\n \nKitchen - The kitchen features handmade cabinets and a handmade table along with stove, fridge, microwave, toaster, and coffee pot. Cookware, spices, etc. are available if you’re in the mood to make your own meals.\n \nPlease note:\nPart of Terlingua Ghost Town’s fun is a bit of funk. It is rugged and remote country.  While most guests prefer the new indoor bathroom, some adventurous travelers prefer to use the original semi-enclose bathhouse or the outhouse.  Because we are located on the hillside, there are multiple levels.  Be prepared to walk up and down short steps and dirt trails.  There’s also a trail through the ruins to the famous Terlingua Porch.\n \nTerlingua is in the Chihuahuan Desert in a remote and rural area. There are no streetlights, and the road to the house is about a half mile of unpaved road. Please drive slowly.\n \nPlease, do not climb on any of the ruins or remove any artifacts.  It is a fragile area.InteractionWe manage several properties and live a few miles away. We are available by phone, text, email, or messages through Airbnb.

      "No Stock Ranch: Two-bedroom two bath vacation home with large porch on a secluded ranch property.\n•\tComfortable Home on 20 Private Acres \n•\tAmazing Mountain Views from Porch\n•\tSpacious Covered Porch \n•\tCovered Parking and Central Heat & AirThe SpaceNo Stock Ranch is a comfortable two-bedroom vacation rental home on a twenty-acre Terlingua Ranch property. Originally built as a retirement home and family retreat, the owner has decided to share it as a vacation rental. Guests are invited to make No Stock Ranch their home away from home in the Big Bend region. Just thirty minutes from Big Bend National Park and the Terlingua Ghost Town.\n \nLocated on 20 secluded acres, this property provides a measure of solitude and serenity that is rare in the modern world. Relax on the porch swing while watching the stars or go for a quiet walk through the arroyo, down the ranch roads, or up the scenic hill. Sleep well in the comfortable beds. Share meals prepared in the full kitchen or charcoal grill. Take the short drive to Big Bend National park, the Rio Grande River, or the famous Terlingua Ghost Town.\n \nThe full kitchen is stocked with everything the typical family or small group will need for cooking meals or making drinks. There is also plenty of space for putting away your groceries. The kitchen is open to the living room and the dining area, allowing for time together when meals are being prepared. The living room has a large sofa, a relaxing easy chair, and barrel chair, plus a flat screen television with DirecTV.\n \nThere are two bedrooms. The master has a king-size bed plus a flat screen television with DirecTV. The guest bedroom has a queen-size bed. There are also two full bathrooms.\n \nThe rear deck faces south for sunrise and sunset views and overlooks White Mill Creek. It is partly covered for shade and partly open for enjoying the starry night skies. White Mill Creek is a heavily vegetated arroyo that is mostly dry except for during and after heavy rains. It creates a haven for desert wildlife, including birds, rabbits, mule deer, javelina, foxes, bobcats, and much more. The area around the house is landscaped with native plants and stone walkways. The area is very rugged, so enjoy the diverse terrain but watch your step.\n \nRelax around the house, explore the property, or head out to Big Bend National Park, the river, or the Ghost Town. No Stock Ranch is the ideal home away from home. We’ll be pleased to have you as our guests.NeighborhoodTERLINGUA RANCH: Located between Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State Park and including much of the town of Terlingua, Terlingua Ranch is a private subdivision of over 190,000 acres, divided into 9,500 tracts owned by about 5,000 individuals and crisscrossed by 1,100 miles of dirt and rock roads. Tracts range from five acres to several hundred acres. It is some of the most rugged and scenic land in Texas. \n\nBack in the 1960’s, the Ghost Town and much of what later became “Terlingua Ranch” was owned by racing legend and car designer extraordinaire, Carol Shelby and some of his friends. The decided to promote the area by holding a chili cook-off in the then abandoned Ghost Town. That little stunt of a cook-off grew into CASI (Chili Appreciation Society International) which now hosts nearly 500 chili cook-offs around the nation and internationally, all leading up the championship cook-off every year in Terlingua. Shelby and friends later subdivided the Ranch and started selling it off to hunters and rugged naturalists. Over the decades, the area was reborn and an eclectic community of nature lovers, artists, musicians, adventurers, and folks just wanting to escape from “civilization” has grown and started to resettle this rough country. \n\nPeople have come and gone. New buildings have risen while others have fallen, Dreams have been realized and others crushed. Through it all, the land remains. The harsh desert and vast openness encourages positive development and slowly swallows up and recovers from past abuses. The old cinnabar mine sites and ranching outposts persist as relics and ghost towns, some redeveloped, some carefully preserved, and others dissolving back into the desert. Abandoned dreams eventually become points of interests for those of us that stumble upon them decades later. Terlingua Ranch is a bizarre mix of old and new, good and bad, growth and decline, all completely unregulated. Modern homes with high values and stunning designs stand beside dilapidated do-it-yourself mistakes and abandoned ruins of the 1800’s and early 1900’s. \n\nThe landscape is even more varied than the people and the structures. Rugged mountains, deep canyons, wild arroyos, dry and wet creeks, peaceful valleys, breathtaking badlands, moonscape like mud flats, the remains of ancient volcanoes, and fossilized ancient seabeds. All of it nurturing a vast array of plant life and wildlife. Around every corner and over every hill lies new and unexpected surprises. \n\nThe Ranch is now home to a few hundred hardy souls. It is also dotted with a diverse array of vacation rental lodging options and campsites. Like the diverse land, they range in quality, style, value, and price. A few are amazing dream destinations. Some are good places to sleep. Others are the stuff of nightmares. (We don’t manage any in the nightmare category.)\n\nBig Bend Vacation Rentals started out in 2007 and initially managed three of the first four vacation rentals in the Terlingua and Terlingua Ranch area. We now manage dozens out of a couple of hundred options. We represent dozens of property owners and have hosted tens of thousands of guests. You can trust us as managers, and you can rely on the properties that we manage. We have become very selective about the properties and the property owners that we add to our portfolio.

      "Crystal Mountain Cabin: Custom Built in 2019. Secluded and Private.\n•\tModern Home on 65 Private Acres\n•\tLarge Livingroom and Kitchen\n•\tPatios and Decks with Mountain Views\n•\tFire Ring for Campfires & S'moresThe SpaceCrystal Mountain Cabin was custom built in 2019. Relax inside or outside and enjoy the mountain views. Built to accommodate four guests in comfort and style.\n\nRent one home or two. The listing is for one home. If you have a larger group, consider booking Crystal Mountain Two, that listing is for this same house PLUS another home next door. The second home is for overflow only and never rents out separately. You will never have to share your space or the 65 acres with anyone other than your own group.\n\nCrystal Mountain Cabin on Terlingua Ranch is the ideal home base for your visit to the Big Bend Region. Modern design will set the perfect tone for your Big Bend adventure.  The surprising seclusion will provide ample privacy and solitude.\n \nRelax inside or outside. Lots of space, large windows, covered decks, a large stone patio, and 65 private acres provide lots of options on where to hang out. \n\nAt night watch meteors fall and satellites fly overhead as you marvel at the Milky Way. Relax around the campfire with a refreshing beverage, maybe even a sausage on a stick, or better yet, some s’mores. Whatever you eat and drink around the fire ring, will go well with campfire stories, some songs, or whatever else you want to do. It’s just you and your partner, or family and friends, under a starry Texas sky.\n\nDuring the day, head into to park, down to Terlingua, or to the Rio Grande, or just enjoy the home and the secluded 65 acres of Chihuahuan Desert habitat. At the property, relax inside or outside or go for a hike around the rugged and scenic property. Wildlife and diverse desert plant life and abundant and varied.\n\nThe living room and kitchen are open concept with lots of space and amazing views through large picture windows. The kitchen is fully stocked with dishes, cookware, utensils, a large fridge, glass top stove and oven, dishwasher, and all the basics you would expect in a large kitchen. The bedrooms have king bed in the master and a queen bed in the second bedroom. The bathroom is spacious and stylish with two sinks and a large shower.\n\nTerlingua Ranch Lodge, just ten minutes away has the Bad Rabbit Café; for great food, cold drinks, and frequent live music. The lodge office is also the place to register if you want to explore the Christmas Mountain conservation area. Terlingua and the western entrance to Big Bend National Park is a short 35-minute drive away. Adventure outfitters located in Terlingua offer river trips, horseback riding, jeep tours, ATV adventures, Jeep rentals, guided hikes, and mountain bike rentals. The famous Terlingua Ghost Town is just 40 minutes away. Both the Ghost Town and the Terlingua/Study Butte area offer shopping, dining, drinking, live music, art galleries, and more. Heading another 15 minutes west from Terlingua will take you to Lajitas for more upscale dining options, a few great shops, and the chance to meet Clay Henry, the beer drinking goat that happens to be the mayor. Big Bend Ranch State Park (the national park’s wild and rugged cousin) is right there as well. Stop in at the Barton Warnock center just before you get to Lajitas for an overview of the park, museum, and a terrific book shop. Alpine, Fort Davis, Marfa, and the McDonald Observatory are also within easy day trip range.\n \nCome on down. Enjoy the Big Bend. Do as much or as little as you like. You’ll have a memorable time and will likely start planning your return trip before you even leave. That’s great. We’ll love to have come back over and over. In fact, that’s how the owner of Crystal Mountain became the owner. He came out here so often and enjoyed staying at other Big Bend Vacation Rental properties so much that he eventually decided to acquire his own properties. He now owns Crystal Mountain One and Two and Crystal Valley, just a short drive away. He was very deliberate and considerate in incorporating all the things he enjoyed the most at other rentals, plus adding extra touches to create the ultimate Big Bend vacation home base. Now, he’s eager to share it all with you.Guest AccessThe whole house and 65 private acres are exclusively yours. The house next door will remain vacant, unless you add it to your rental.

Tracts range from five acres to several hundred acres. It is some of the most rugged and scenic land in Texas. \n\nBack in the 1960’s, the Ghost Town and much of what later became “Terlingua Ranch” was owned by racing legend and car designer extraordinaire, Carol Shelby and some of his friends. The decided to promote the area by holding a chili cook-off in the then abandoned Ghost Town. That little stunt of a cook-off grew into CASI (Chili Appreciation Society International) which now hosts nearly 500 chili cook-offs around the nation and internationally, all leading up the championship cook-off every year in Terlingua. Shelby and friends later subdivided the Ranch and started selling it off to hunters and rugged naturalists. Over the decades, the area was reborn and an eclectic community of nature lovers, artists, musicians, adventurers, and folks just wanting to escape from “civilization” has grown and started to resettle this rough country. \n\nPeople have come and gone. New buildings have risen while others have fallen, Dreams have been realized and others crushed. Through it all, the land remains. The harsh desert and vast openness encourages positive development and slowly swallows up and recovers from past abuses. The old cinnabar mine sites and ranching outposts persist as relics and ghost towns, some redeveloped, some carefully preserved, and others dissolving back into the desert. Abandoned dreams eventually become points of interests for those of us that stumble upon them decades later. Terlingua Ranch is a bizarre mix of old and new, good and bad, growth and decline, all completely unregulated. Modern homes with high values and stunning designs stand beside dilapidated do-it-yourself mistakes and abandoned ruins of the 1800’s and early 1900’s. \n\nThe landscape is even more varied than the people and the structures. Rugged mountains, deep canyons, wild arroyos, dry and wet creeks, peaceful valleys, breathtaking badlands, moonscape like mud flats, the remains of ancient volcanoes, and fossilized ancient seabeds. All of it nurturing a vast array of plant life and wildlife. Around every corner and over every hill lies new and unexpected surprises. \n\nThe Ranch is now home to a few hundred hardy souls. It is also dotted with a diverse array of vacation rental lodging options and campsites. Like the diverse land, they range in quality, style, value, and price. A few are amazing dream destinations. Some are good places to sleep. Others are the stuff of nightmares. (We don’t manage any in the nightmare category.)\n\nBig Bend Vacation Rentals started out in 2007 and initially managed three of the first four vacation rentals in the Terlingua and Terlingua Ranch area. We now manage dozens out of a couple of hundred options. We represent dozens of property owners and have hosted tens of thousands of guests. You can trust us as managers, and you can rely on the properties that we manage. We have become very selective about the properties and the property owners that we add to our portfolio.

These might not appear in quote and will be added if applicable.\n     Dog Fee: $150 for one or two dogs. No more than two dogs allowed.\n\nTerlingua Sky is a modern solar powered home with rustic flare and amazing mountain views, located on a hilltop near the Terlingua Ghost Town. With two bedrooms, two full baths, an open plan living room, dining room, and kitchen, plus great porches, you’ll have plenty of room to relax and enjoy the tranquility of the Big Bend. The amazing views of the Chisos Mountains are simply breathtaking. \n \nNamed for our amazingly clear skies, Terlingua Sky, is perfectly situated for enjoying awe inspiring views at any time of day or night.  Sunrises are unparalleled thanks to unobstructed views of the sun rising over the Chisos Mountains to the east. Daytime views include endless horizons of scenic mountains in the US and Mexico. Sunset views will find you looking more to the east than the west, as the reddening rays of the sun light up the mountains with dynamic displays of color and light. Nighttime views of the starry skies or bright moon are inspirational. The stars at night truly are big and bright deep in the heart of Big Bend country.\n \nWhile you’ll be tempted to spend all your time outside, you’ll definitely find the inside to be inviting, comfortable, and visually appealing. The home is solidly built with heavy gauge steel structural supports and an all metal roof. The exterior has a classic stucco finish and the interior is beautiful wood and tile. All the furnishings were selected for comfort and style. The master bedroom has a king-sized bed and the second bedroom has a queen. Both have private bathrooms with stylish tile showers. The living, dining, and kitchen area is open and spacious. Perfect for enjoying time together with your family or friends. Of course, privacy is also important. That’s why the interior walls are all insulated for sound dampening.\n \nThe home is brilliantly designed for both comfort and eco-efficiency. The professionally designed solar power system provides ample power for all the modern comforts, including a highly efficient air-conditioning system. Extensive shading, insulation, and high-quality windows ensures that the home requires minimal use of the air-conditioning or heating systems. Take advantage of our cool summer nights and warm winter days by opening the windows and enjoying fresh desert air. The shaded porches allow you to enjoy the outdoor views and breezes without being overwhelmed by the desert sun. They also shade the house and help provide comfort inside. For rare occasions when the solar array and large battery bank does not provide enough power, the home is equipped with an auto-start back-up generator. Regardless of power consumption, you will never run out of electricity.\n \nWater is rare and precious in the desert. Water at Terlingua Sky comes from the sky. An extensive rain catchment system collects rainwater and stores it for future use. We request that guests conserve water as much as is comfortable. Our first concern is for your comfort.  The rainwater is filtered and treated for household use. However, it is not officially tested and approved as potable. We provide bottled water for drinking, making coffee, cooking, and any other human consumption.\n \nMost of our guests are coming out here to explore Big Bend National Park, the Rio Grande River, Big Bend Ranch State Park, and the Terlingua Ghost Town. Terlingua Sky is perfectly located for easy access to all these local attractions, but just far enough off the beaten path to enjoy privacy and solitude. After all you probably didn’t drive hundreds of miles into the middle of nowhere just to be crowded by noisy or nosy neighbors.\n \nAs our guests, you will be able to pursue all sorts of wild adventure or history of the parks and river, the lively social scene with art, dining, and live entertainment in the Ghost Town and other local venues, explore the nearby ruins from the heyday of Terlingua Cinnabar mining, or simply relax and unwind. However you decide to spend your time under the Terlingua sky, you’ll be able to leave here as exhausted or refreshed as you want. Don’t worry if you don’t get to do it all in one visit. You’re welcome to return time and time again.InteractionWe manage several properties and live few miles away. We are available by phone, text, email, or messages through Airbnb.

      "Sunrise Ridge: Relax Inside or Outside. Newly Built Home. Three Miles from Terlingua Ranch Pool.\n•\tModern Home Spacious Southwestern Style\n•\tOpen Kitchen, Dining, and Living Room \n•\tScreened in Dining Porch \n•\tLarge Porches with Mountain ViewsThe SpaceEXTRA FEES MAY APPLY. These might not appear in quote and will be added if applicable.\n     Dog Fees: $100 for one dog. $150 for two dogs. No more than two dogs allowed.\n\nSunrise Ridge is a brand-new vacation rental. Built in 2017 by a couple that loves the Big Bend and wanted the perfect vacation home for themselves and to share with others.\n\nWonderful home, built in 2017, nestled into a gentle valley bordering the Christmas Mountains. Get away from everything with incredible, always-changing views in all directions, while still enjoying many modern amenities and easy access to Terlingua Ranch Headquarters, the surrounding towns, and Big Bend National Park.\n \nSunrise Ridge is designed to be open and welcoming, maximizing comfort and offering multiple outdoor spaces that connect you with the magic of the Chihuahuan Desert. An enormous covered porch with stunning views of the Corazones Peaks often offers a breeze even in the warmest months, inviting you to relax in a rocking chair or nap in the double hammock. French doors lead to a cozy screened porch in back with lovely views into the Christmas Mountains. Inside, high ceilings, Saltillo tile floors and exposed wooden beams in the spacious living room provide an attractive space to sit and socialize or simply relax and read when you're not out exploring the area. Central air-conditioning and ceiling fans keep you cool in summer and warm in winter.\n \nAcross an amazing granite-topped island, the modern kitchen has stainless steel appliances, including dishwasher. And it's fully stocked with all the equipment you need, whether putting together snacks for a hike or cooking dinner for everyone. An outdoor gas grill is also available for use.\n \nTwo bedrooms occupy the back of the house, each with access to an outdoor porch. One contains a queen bed and the other has two twin beds, all with Tuft and Needle custom foam mattresses. Like the living room, each bedroom has its own individually controlled central A/C and ceiling fan to keep things comfortable. A Jack-and-Jill bathroom offers privacy for each bedroom's residents, with a large Saltillo tile shower in the middle.\n \nA half mile away from the closest neighbor, Sunrise Ridge offers sublime quiet and solitude. From the moment, the sun comes up over the eastern ridge of the valley, which has a pristine view of the Chisos Mountains and Big Bend National Park, the desert valley comes alive with wildlife and color, and there's enough space for hours of hiking to enjoy it all. As evening approaches, enjoy magnificent displays of shifting color and light as the sun sets on the other side of the valley, making way for a night so bright with stars that the Milky Way literally lights up the desert.\n \nFrom Sunrise Ridge, you are well-positioned for day trips across the West Texas area. To the North, you can drive to Fort Davis and the McDonald Observatory, Marfa and the Chinati Art Foundation, or Alpine and Sul Ross University's Museum of the Big Bend. Drive south and you'll find Terlingua Ghost Town, the south entrance to Big Bend National Park (about 50 minutes away), and the Big Bend Ranch State Park. Closer to home, about two miles from the house, is Terlingua Ranch Headquarters, where you can grab some grub and maybe some live music at the Bad Rabbit Cafe, before retreating back to the valley and the quiet of your desert home.\n \nBeing isolated doesn't mean being out of touch, though, and Sunrise Ridge has high-speed satellite internet and phone service to keep you plugged in, should you need it when you're not taking in all the other marvels that the Chihuahuan Desert and West Texas have to offer. We welcome you to share in the wonders of this unique and restorative place.NeighborhoodTERLINGUA RANCH: Located between Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State Park and including much of the town of Terlingua, Terlingua Ranch is a private subdivision of over 190,000 acres, divided into 9,500 tracts owned by about 5,000 individuals and crisscrossed by 1,100 miles of dirt and rock roads. Tracts range from five acres to several hundred acres. It is some of the most rugged and scenic land in Texas. \n\nBack in the 1960’s, the Ghost Town and much of what later became “Terlingua Ranch” was owned by racing legend and car designer extraordinaire, Carol Shelby and some of his friends. The decided to promote the area by holding a chili cook-off in the then abandoned Ghost Town. That little stunt of a cook-off grew into CASI (Chili Appreciation Society International) which now hosts nearly 500 chili cook-offs around the nation and internationally, all leading up the championship cook-off every year in Terlingua. Shelby and friends later subdivided the Ranch and started selling it off to hunters and rugged naturalists. Over the decades, the area was reborn and an eclectic community of nature lovers, artists, musicians, adventurers, and folks just wanting to escape from “civilization” has grown and started to resettle this rough country. \n\nPeople have come and gone. New buildings have risen while others have fallen, Dreams have been realized and others crushed. Through it all, the land remains. The harsh desert and vast openness encourages positive development and slowly swallows up and recovers from past abuses. The old cinnabar mine sites and ranching outposts persist as relics and ghost towns, some redeveloped, some carefully preserved, and others dissolving back into the desert. Abandoned dreams eventually become points of interests for those of us that stumble upon them decades later. Terlingua Ranch is a bizarre mix of old and new, good and bad, growth and decline, all completely unregulated. Modern homes with high values and stunning designs stand beside dilapidated do-it-yourself mistakes and abandoned ruins of the 1800’s and early 1900’s. \n\nThe landscape is even more varied than the people and the structures. Rugged mountains, deep canyons, wild arroyos, dry and wet creeks, peaceful valleys, breathtaking badlands, moonscape like mud flats, the remains of ancient volcanoes, and fossilized ancient seabeds. All of it nurturing a vast array of plant life and wildlife. Around every corner and over every hill lies new and unexpected surprises. \n\nThe Ranch is now home to a few hundred hardy souls. It is also dotted with a diverse array of vacation rental lodging options and campsites. Like the diverse land, they range in quality, style, value, and price. A few are amazing dream destinations. Some are good places to sleep. Others are the stuff of nightmares. (We don’t manage any in the nightmare category.)\n\nBig Bend Vacation Rentals started out in 2007 and initially managed three of the first four vacation rentals in the Terlingua and Terlingua Ranch area. We now manage dozens out of a couple of hundred options. We represent dozens of property owners and have hosted tens of thousands of guests. You can trust us as managers, and you can rely on the properties that we manage. We have become very selective about the properties and the property owners that we add to our portfolio.

The sleeping loft has a low ceiling and is best suited for teens.\n \nThe living room area has a full-size futon that can be made out as a bed. There is a small TV with a built-in DVD player. We do have a few DVDs. Feel free to bring your own but you’ll probably spend more time on the porch watching the stars and Terlingua Creek.\n\nThe kitchen has a refrigerator, oven, range, microwave, toaster, coffee maker. There are also plates, silverware, glasses for your use. Pots and pans are also provided.\n \nThe bathroom is small but has a shower, toilet and sink with hot running water.\n \nThe cabin is cooled and heated by two mini split air conditioning systems.\n \nSherri’s Terlingua Cabin is located on a bluff above a spring fed section of Terlingua Creek. Most of the time there is just a foot or two of water in this section of the creek. But when it rains it can become a raging torrent in the canyon below the cabin. Be careful near the edge of the cliff. The ground can shift dangerously and unexpectedly.\n\nNo pets or children under the age of 12 are allowed at the cabin.InteractionWe manage several properties and live few miles away.

      "Fossil Knob Ridge One: Relax is Style at this Ultra-Modern Container Home Near Terlingua Ghost TownThe SpaceHigh Clearance Vehicle Recommended due to rough and rocky roads.\n\nBook your vacation at the ultimate modern vacation rentals in the rugged outback of the Big Bend region. In a land of endless mountain and desert vistas that is famed for ghost town ruins, rustic adobes, and Old West ranch homes, the Fossil Knob Ridge vacation rentals offer a unique contrast. The ultra-modern vacation rentals at Fossil Knob Ridge are contemporary homes built from recycled shipping containers. Yes, you read that right. These vacation rental homes are constructed from big metal boxes that were originally used for transporting cargo across the globe on trains and ocean freighters. The owner purchased them from a shipping company and converted them into contemporary and stylish living spaces. Don’t worry though, they are far more than just metal boxes with some furniture. Indeed, these homes offer the most neoteric lodging in the Terlingua area.\n\nThe Chisos House is an ultra-modern home built from two recycled shipping containers, one forty feet long and one twenty feet long. They are joined together at a 90° angle around a large, shaded patio. The forty contains the living room, dining area, and kitchen. The twenty contains the bathroom and bedroom. Modern design, styling, and art are featured inside and out. Please view the photos for the best description.\n\nChisos House sleeps two to three guests. The bedroom has a king-sized bed and the living room has a sofa. The sofa does not fold out but it can be used for one person to sleep on. If you have a larger group, or simply want more space, there are five modern vacation rental homes at Fossil Knob Ridge. We'd be happy to rent you more than one. Check out the other Fossil Knob Ridge listings. You are welcome to rent as many as you want.\n\nAll four of the Fossil Knob Ridge Rentals are on the electric grid for reliable and ample electric power. Both are fully air-conditioned and heated and have modern electric appliances. Potable water is trucked in and stored in holding tanks for your use. There is plenty of water available but trucking it in is expensive. We ask that you conserve it, but not so much as to compromise your comfort.\n\nLocated just one mile northwest of the world famous Terlingua Ghost Town and twenty miles northwest of the Chisos Mountains in Big Bend National Park. Fossil Knob Ridge overlooks the Ghost Town and has breathtaking mountain views, including the Chisos Mountains and into Mexico.\n\nRelax inside the house or on the shaded patio. Explore the fossil strewn 20 acre property. Drive or walk into the Ghost Town to explore the historic ruins, dine, drink, enjoy live music, or hang out with local and travelers from around the globe. If you play an instrument or sing, join in on an impromptu jam, session on the porch of the old trading post. Drive into Big Bend Nation Park or Big Bend Ranch State park for endless outdoor adventures. Book a river trip, jeep tour, horseback ride, mountain bike rental, guided hike, or guided hunt. Enjoy a controlled campfire. Marvel at the night skies. Watch the stunning sunrises and sunsets. Do as much or as little as you like. Then, come back again and do even more or less.InteractionWe manage several properties and live several miles away. We are available by phone, text, email, or messaging.

No city noise or congestion, no close neighbors, and no traffic. Just the solitude of the remote Chihuahuan Desert and the Christmas Mountains. Plenty of wildlife and diverse desert plant life. We even have trees along the arroyo out back. Relax inside, with air-conditioning, comfortable, and attractive furnishings, and modern fixtures. Enjoy all day shade and 24-hour views from the comfort of the wrap around cover decks, furnished with chairs, tables, lighting, and a grill.\n\nAdventure is in abundance with the rugged and dynamic desert landscape. Follow the marked trail down to the arroyo and watch for birds and other wildlife. Enjoy the crystal-clear water of the Terlingua Ranch pool. Hike or drive (4WD) through the Christmas Mountains (register for free access at the Terlingua Ranch Lodge) for breathtaking views. That’s all in the immediate neighborhood. Drive a little further and take in all the wonders of Big Bend National Park, Big Bend Ranch State Park, Rio Grande River or the Terlingua Ghost Town. Local adventure outfitters offer river trips, jeep tours, guided hikes, bike rentals, horseback riding, sightseeing tours, and more.\n\nConvenience is provided with WiFi, modern appliances, full bathroom, comfortable lodging, nearby pool, and lodge restaurant. While the last four miles of roads are dirt, they are well maintained and easily driven by a typical car, without any need for high clearance or 4WD. We also provide easy reservation service and clear communication plus quick local service if there is ever a question, concern, or problem. \n\nAs an added bit of adventure and convenience, we even provide the option for you to fly in. The Terlingua Ranch airstrip is just a short walk away and can accommodate small private planes. Don’t worry about the noise, the strip is rarely used and only during daylight hours.\n\nWhile the Big Bend region offers a wide range of lodging options for our visitors, very few vacation rentals can compare to Christmas Mountains Ranch as all-around great place to stay. The owners have taken great care to build and furnish a home base for their Big Bend visits. It was completed in 2020 and graciously opened up for others to enjoy. Our team at Big Bend Vacation Rentals is proud to manage it. As the one of the longest serving and the most established vacation rental management provider in the Terlingua Area, we are eager to serve as your host.NeighborhoodTERLINGUA RANCH: Located between Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State Park and including much of the town of Terlingua, Terlingua Ranch is a private subdivision of over 190,000 acres, divided into 9,500 tracts owned by about 5,000 individuals and crisscrossed by 1,100 miles of dirt and rock roads. Tracts range from five acres to several hundred acres. It is some of the most rugged and scenic land in Texas. \n\nBack in the 1960’s, the Ghost Town and much of what later became “Terlingua Ranch” was owned by racing legend and car designer extraordinaire, Carol Shelby and some of his friends. The decided to promote the area by holding a chili cook-off in the then abandoned Ghost Town. That little stunt of a cook-off grew into CASI (Chili Appreciation Society International) which now hosts nearly 500 chili cook-offs around the nation and internationally, all leading up the championship cook-off every year in Terlingua. Shelby and friends later subdivided the Ranch and started selling it off to hunters and rugged naturalists. Over the decades, the area was reborn and an eclectic community of nature lovers, artists, musicians, adventurers, and folks just wanting to escape from “civilization” has grown and started to resettle this rough country. \n\nPeople have come and gone. New buildings have risen while others have fallen, Dreams have been realized and others crushed. Through it all, the land remains. The harsh desert and vast openness encourages positive development and slowly swallows up and recovers from past abuses. The old cinnabar mine sites and ranching outposts persist as relics and ghost towns, some redeveloped, some carefully preserved, and others dissolving back into the desert. Abandoned dreams eventually become points of interests for those of us that stumble upon them decades later. Terlingua Ranch is a bizarre mix of old and new, good and bad, growth and decline, all completely unregulated. Modern homes with high values and stunning designs stand beside dilapidated do-it-yourself mistakes and abandoned ruins of the 1800’s and early 1900’s. \n\nThe landscape is even more varied than the people and the structures. Rugged mountains, deep canyons, wild arroyos, dry and wet creeks, peaceful valleys, breathtaking badlands, moonscape like mud flats, the remains of ancient volcanoes, and fossilized ancient seabeds. All of it nurturing a vast array of plant life and wildlife. Around every corner and over every hill lies new and unexpected surprises. \n\nThe Ranch is now home to a few hundred hardy souls. It is also dotted with a diverse array of vacation rental lodging options and campsites. Like the diverse land, they range in quality, style, value, and price. A few are amazing dream destinations. Some are good places to sleep. Others are the stuff of nightmares. (We don’t manage any in the nightmare category.)\n\nBig Bend Vacation Rentals started out in 2007 and initially managed three of the first four vacation rentals in the Terlingua and Terlingua Ranch area. We now manage dozens out of a couple of hundred options. We represent dozens of property owners and have hosted tens of thousands of guests. You can trust us as managers, and you can rely on the properties that we manage. We have become very selective about the properties and the property owners that we add to our portfolio. Visit our website at www.BigBendVacations.com.InteractionWe manage several properties and live a few miles away. We are available by phone, text, email, or messages. We are typically only on site for cleaning or maintenance issues.Other things to noteFrom Christmas Mountains Ranch it will take you approximately 45 minutes to get to the west entrance of the Big Bend National Park.",

      "Fossil Knob Ridge - Rainbow House: Relax is Style at this Ultra-Modern Container Home Near Terlingua Ghost TownThe SpaceHigh Clearance Vehicle Recommended due to rough and rocky roads.\n\nBook your vacation at the ultimate modern vacation rentals in the rugged outback of the Big Bend region. In a land of endless mountain and desert vistas that is famed for ghost town ruins, rustic adobes, and Old West ranch homes, the Fossil Knob Ridge vacation rentals offer a unique contrast. The ultra-modern vacation rentals at Fossil Knob Ridge are contemporary homes built from recycled shipping containers. Yes, you read that right. These vacation rental homes are constructed from big metal boxes that were originally used for transporting cargo across the globe on trains and ocean freighters. The owner purchased them from a shipping company and converted them into contemporary and stylish living spaces. Don’t worry though, they are far more than just metal boxes with some furniture. Indeed, these homes offer the most neoteric lodging in the Terlingua area.\n\nFossil Knob Ridge offers four separate units. Each rental is similarly styled but each is unique in size, layout, design, furnishings, amenities, views, and occupancy level. The rentals are named after some of the local cinnabar mines that were the basis of settlement of this region in the late 1800's and early 1900's. The Chisos and 248 rentals sleep up to four. Chisos has a King bed and a queen fold out sofa. The 248 has two king beds. The Rainbow and Mariscal rentals are a little smaller and both sleep two, with a king bed in each.\n\nTHIS LISTING IS FOR THE RAINBOW HOUSE AT FOSSIL KNOB RIDGE.\n \nThe Rainbow House is an ultra-modern home built from two recycled 20’ shipping containers. Joined together and offset from one another to create a comfortable living space. Living area, dining area, bedroom and kitchen. Modern design, styling, and art are featured inside and out. Please view the photos for the best description.\n \nSleeps two guests. The bedroom has a king-sized bed. If you have a larger group, or simply want more space, we recommend booking multiple rentals at Fossil Knob Ridge. It is close by but faces away from the other rentals. All rentals have privacy and their own unique views. \n \nEach of the Fossil Knob Ridge Rentals are on the electric grid for reliable and ample electric power. All are fully air-conditioned and heated and have modern electric appliances. Potable water is trucked in and stored in holding tanks for your use. There is plenty of water available but trucking it in is expensive. We ask that you conserve it, but not so much as to compromise your comfort.\n\nLocated just one-mile northwest of the world famous Terlingua Ghost Town and twenty miles northwest of the Chisos Mountains in Big Bend National Park. Fossil Knob Ridge overlooks the Ghost Town and has breathtaking mountain views, including the Chisos Mountains and into Mexico.\nRelax inside or on the shaded patio. Explore the fossil strewn 20-acre property. Drive or walk (it’s a long but enjoyable walk in good weather) into the Ghost Town to explore the historic ruins, dine, drink, enjoy live music, or hang out with local and travelers from around the globe. If you play an instrument or sing, join in on an impromptu jam, session on the porch of the old trading post. Drive into Big Bend Nation Park or Big Bend Ranch State park for endless outdoor adventures. Book a river trip, jeep tour, horseback ride, mountain bike rental, guided hike, or guided hunt. Enjoy a controlled campfire. Marvel at the night skies. Watch the stunning sunrises and sunsets. Do as much or as little as you like. Then, come back again and do even more or even less.Guest AccessA key code is provided after the reservation is confirmed and paid. Guests are welcome to let themselves in and make themselves at home upon arrival at or after the check-in time.InteractionWe manage several properties and live several miles away.

All rentals have privacy and their own unique views. \n \nEach of the Fossil Knob Ridge Rentals are on the electric grid for reliable and ample electric power. All are fully air-conditioned and heated and have modern electric appliances. Potable water is trucked in and stored in holding tanks for your use. There is plenty of water available but trucking it in is expensive. We ask that you conserve water, but not so much as to compromise your comfort.\n\nLocated just one-mile northwest of the world famous Terlingua Ghost Town and twenty miles northwest of the Chisos Mountains in Big Bend National Park. Fossil Knob Ridge overlooks the Ghost Town and has breathtaking mountain views, including the Chisos Mountains and into Mexico.\nRelax inside or on the shaded patio. Explore the fossil strewn 20-acre property. Drive or walk (it’s a long but enjoyable walk in good weather) into the Ghost Town to explore the historic ruins, dine, drink, enjoy live music, or hang out with local and travelers from around the globe. If you play an instrument or sing, join in on an impromptu jam, session on the porch of the old trading post. Drive into Big Bend Nation Park or Big Bend Ranch State park for endless outdoor adventures. Book a river trip, jeep tour, horseback ride, mountain bike rental, guided hike, or guided hunt. Enjoy a controlled campfire. Marvel at the night skies. Watch the stunning sunrises and sunsets. Do as much or as little as you like. Then, come back again and do even more or even less.InteractionWe manage several properties and live several miles away. We are available by phone, text, email, or messaging.

Tracts range from five acres to several hundred acres. It is some of the most rugged and scenic land in Texas. \n\nBack in the 1960’s, the Ghost Town and much of what later became “Terlingua Ranch” was owned by racing legend and car designer extraordinaire, Carol Shelby and some of his friends. The decided to promote the area by holding a chili cook-off in the then abandoned Ghost Town. That little stunt of a cook-off grew into CASI (Chili Appreciation Society International) which now hosts nearly 500 chili cook-offs around the nation and internationally, all leading up the championship cook-off every year in Terlingua. Shelby and friends later subdivided the Ranch and started selling it off to hunters and rugged naturalists. Over the decades, the area was reborn and an eclectic community of nature lovers, artists, musicians, adventurers, and folks just wanting to escape from “civilization” has grown and started to resettle this rough country. \n\nPeople have come and gone. New buildings have risen while others have fallen, Dreams have been realized and others crushed. Through it all, the land remains. The harsh desert and vast openness encourages positive development and slowly swallows up and recovers from past abuses. The old cinnabar mine sites and ranching outposts persist as relics and ghost towns, some redeveloped, some carefully preserved, and others dissolving back into the desert. Abandoned dreams eventually become points of interests for those of us that stumble upon them decades later. Terlingua Ranch is a bizarre mix of old and new, good and bad, growth and decline, all completely unregulated. Modern homes with high values and stunning designs stand beside dilapidated do-it-yourself mistakes and abandoned ruins of the 1800’s and early 1900’s. \n\nThe landscape is even more varied than the people and the structures. Rugged mountains, deep canyons, wild arroyos, dry and wet creeks, peaceful valleys, breathtaking badlands, moonscape like mud flats, the remains of ancient volcanoes, and fossilized ancient seabeds. All of it nurturing a vast array of plant life and wildlife. Around every corner and over every hill lies new and unexpected surprises. \n\nThe Ranch is now home to a few hundred hardy souls. It is also dotted with a diverse array of vacation rental lodging options and campsites. Like the diverse land, they range in quality, style, value, and price. A few are amazing dream destinations. Some are good places to sleep. Others are the stuff of nightmares. (We don’t manage any in the nightmare category.)\n\nBig Bend Vacation Rentals started out in 2007 and initially managed three of the first four vacation rentals in the Terlingua and Terlingua Ranch area. We now manage dozens out of a couple of hundred options. We represent dozens of property owners and have hosted tens of thousands of guests. You can trust us as managers, and you can rely on the properties that we manage. We have become very selective about the properties and the property owners that we add to our portfolio.

      "Beautifully renovated, modern and comfortable 27’ 2001 Airstream on 40 private acres. Two air conditioners and heaters, full kitchen, and bathroom. Step outside barefoot onto a 900 square foot composite deck with incredible views of the National Park. Deck includes a large and stylish outdoor kitchen, couch for lounging, and a propane fire table for cool nights. Enjoy our brand new private modern detached bathhouse, with an indoor and outdoor shower. Occupancy limited to 2 adults. No pets.The SpaceWhat you get:\n•\t27' Renovated 2001 Airstream Safari\n•\t40 private acres\n•\t1800 square feet of roof cover (including covered parking area)\n•\t1000 square feet of outdoor living space including kitchen, propane firetable, lounging couch and dining table\n•\t1/2 mile nature trail\n•\tCustom designed and built bathhouse with indoor and outdoor showers that take full advantage of the views and natural light\n•\tLarge scenic overlook (Gazer Point) with excellent access, offering outstanding 360 degree views of the National Park, Mesa De Anguilla, the desert valley, Lajitas Mesa, and beyond.  \n•\tJuiceBox 40 EV Charger for recharging electric vehicles\n\nThe Airstream: The renovated Airstream is equipped with a kitchen (microwave, small oven, small cooktop and sink), two twinXL beds, a small dining table and a comfortable couch.  A smart TV is provided to stream content using your own Netflix/Hulu account (but we recommend spending your time outdoors!).  The Airstream has 2 air conditioners, 2 sources of heat, and offers Wifi (via DSL). Clean, modern and functional, this is the perfect place to lay your head after a day in the park, or riding the nearby bike trails.\n\nThe Deck: Over 1,000 square feet (GIANT) of covered and decked (composite decking) outdoor living space all to yourself. If you’re looking to relax in style, you’re at the right place. Big Bend StarGazer deck offers a large and stylish outdoor kitchen (cooktop/sink/propane grill/dining table/refrigerator) to enjoy meals at home, a couch for lounging, and a propane firetable for those cool nights.\n\nLighting: Dark sky friendly lights in the outdoor kitchen and living areas, red string lights for stargazing, and a BBQ light for grilling after the sun goes down. Our deck railing has very dim LED's mounted underneath to gently illuminate your surroundings.  \n\nThe Bathhouse: Custom designed and built by the owners, this bathhouse is spacious and modern with hot indoor and hot outdoor showers.  The vibrant blue tile vanity wall is reminiscent of the sea that this once was.  The interior is full of light and offers carefully placed windows to enjoy the surrounding views.  The outdoor shower is large, private, and frames the surrounding mountains for viewing while showering.  Hot water, private entry through the bath house, and incredible views make this an experience you won't forget.  \n\nNote: While we are on septic, both of our showers are graywater that is used to feed trees and sometimes the birds will drink this water.  For that reason we ask that you please use the bath products that we supply, so we keep the birds and trees happy and well! \n\nGazer Point: Enjoy your own jaw dropping private scenic overlook with spectacular 360 views of Big Bend National Park and beyond. Outstanding stargazing opportunities from this overlook; one of the best views in the area - all to yourself! You can hike or drive to the turnaround spot.  The overlook is leveled and has large boulders placed for seating; or bring your own chair and experience the view from anywhere.\n\nGazer Trail: Lovely 1/2 mile meandering trail around the property; great for searching for flora and fauna. Fun morning coffee walk, evening margarita walk or just a ‘stretch out your legs’ walk. Gorgeous views and interesting terrain.  Please stick to the trail as much as possible and only take pictures.\n\nLocation: Excellent location and easy access; driveway is located off of paved scenic road FM170, located close to the hustle and bustle but quiet and private.\n•\t2 minutes from the Lajitas Airport mountain bike trails\n•\t6 minutes to BBRSP mountain bike trail head\n•\t12 minutes to the Big Bend National Park entrance.\n•\t11 minutes to Study Butte gas station\n•\t3 minutes to Long Draw pizza\n•\t8 minutes to Lajitas General Store\n•\t5 minutes to Terlingua Ghosttown/Starlight Theatre\n\nSpecial request of our guests: Please visit and enjoy/relax while leaving no trace. Please be conscientious while visiting the fragile desert ecosystem - stay on the trail and limit your water consumption in the shower and at the sink.  StarGazers water supply is rainwater collection and water is very sparse in the desert.  We request keeping showers to 3 minutes.  Please do not remove fossils or rocks from the property - instead take a picture and leave it for the next person to discover.  Thank you for respecting Big Bend and the surrounding desert, treading lightly, and practicing sustainable living during your visit.\n\nOccupancy limited to 2 adults. No pets.NeighborhoodLocation: Excellent location and easy access; driveway is located off of paved scenic road FM170, located close to the hustle and bustle but quiet and private.\n•\t2 minutes from the Lajitas Airport mountain bike trails\n•\t6 minutes to BBRSP mountain bike trail head\n•\t12 minutes to the Big Bend National Park entrance.\n•\t11 minutes to Study Butte gas station\n•\t3 minutes to Long Draw pizza\n•\t8 minutes to Lajitas General Store\n•\t5 minutes to Terlingua Ghosttown/Starlight TheatreInteractionWe manage several properties and live a few miles away.

      "Fossil Knob Ridge - Buena Suerte House: Relax is Style at this Ultra-Modern Container Home Near Terlingua Ghost TownThe SpaceHigh Clearance Vehicle Recommended due to rough and rocky roads.\n\nBook your vacation at the ultimate modern vacation rentals in the rugged outback of the Big Bend region. In a land of endless mountain and desert vistas that is famed for ghost town ruins, rustic adobes, and Old West ranch homes, the Fossil Knob Ridge vacation rentals offer a unique contrast. The ultra-modern vacation rentals at Fossil Knob Ridge are contemporary homes built from recycled shipping containers. Yes, you read that right. These vacation rental homes are constructed from big metal boxes that were originally used for transporting cargo across the globe on trains and ocean freighters. The owner purchased them from a shipping company and converted them into contemporary and stylish living spaces. Don’t worry though, they are far more than just metal boxes with some furniture. Indeed, these homes offer the most neoteric lodging in the Terlingua area.\n\nFossil Knob Ridge offers four separate units. Each rental is similarly styled but each is unique in size, layout, design, furnishings, amenities, views, and occupancy level. The rentals are named after some of the local cinnabar mines that were the basis of settlement of this region in the late 1800's and early 1900's. The Chisos and 248 rentals sleep up to four. Chisos has a King bed and a queen fold out sofa. The 248 has two king beds. The Rainbow and Mariscal rentals are a little smaller and both sleep two, with a king bed in each.\n\nTHIS LISTING IS FOR THE BUENA SUERTE HOUSE AT FOSSIL KNOB RIDGE.\n \nThe Buena Suerte House is an ultra-modern home built from a recycled 40’ shipping container. Custom designed to create a comfortable living space. Living area, dining area, bedroom and kitchen. Modern design, styling, and art are featured inside and out. Please view the photos for the best description.\n \nSleeps two guests. The bedroom has a king-sized bed. If you have a larger group, or simply want more space, we recommend booking multiple rentals at Fossil Knob Ridge. It is close by but faces away from the other rentals. All rentals have privacy and their own unique views. \n \nEach of the Fossil Knob Ridge Rentals are on the electric grid for reliable and ample electric power. All are fully air-conditioned and heated and have modern electric appliances. Potable water is trucked in and stored in holding tanks for your use. There is plenty of water available but trucking it in is expensive. We ask that you conserve it, but not so much as to compromise your comfort.\n\nLocated just one-mile northwest of the world famous Terlingua Ghost Town and twenty miles northwest of the Chisos Mountains in Big Bend National Park. Fossil Knob Ridge overlooks the Ghost Town and has breathtaking mountain views, including the Chisos Mountains and into Mexico.\nRelax inside or on the shaded patio. Explore the fossil strewn 20-acre property. Drive or walk (it’s a long but enjoyable walk in good weather) into the Ghost Town to explore the historic ruins, dine, drink, enjoy live music, or hang out with local and travelers from around the globe. If you play an instrument or sing, join in on an impromptu jam, session on the porch of the old trading post. Drive into Big Bend Nation Park or Big Bend Ranch State park for endless outdoor adventures. Book a river trip, jeep tour, horseback ride, mountain bike rental, guided hike, or guided hunt. Enjoy a controlled campfire. Marvel at the night skies. Watch the stunning sunrises and sunsets. Do as much or as little as you like. Then, come back again and do even more or even less.Guest AccessA key code is provided after the reservation is confirmed and paid. Guests are welcome to let themselves in and make themselves at home upon arrival at or after the check-in time.InteractionWe manage several properties and live several miles away. We are available by phone, text, email, or messaging. We are typically only on site for cleaning or maintenance issues.",

Once you pull through the gate onto Boulder Ridge Ranch, you won't want to leave. This rental home has everything you could want for a relaxing and memorable Big Bend getaway. Situated on 80 acres of beautiful, rugged, and private land, this property provides privacy, seclusion, comfort, and unique style. \n\nThere is plenty of room for up to six discerning guests. Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, full kitchen, indoor and outdoor dining tables, spacious living room, lots of covered patio space, a separate building with a studio space and kitchenette, covered parking. 80 acres, endless views, total privacy, and so much more. \n\nThe one downside of this property is a bit of a bumpy rock road to get here. We recommend high clearance, AWD, or 4WD. However, a typical sedan can easily make the drive if the driver is cautious, watches the road closely. Either way, don't rush the drive. Take it slow and easy. Driving too fast down the rock road will be uncomfortable you and your vehicle. The views are great all along the drive, which is another good reason to take it slow. Once at the house, you'll agree that the rough drive is worth it. \n\nAll linens are provided and the kitchen is stocked with everything but your groceries.NeighborhoodTERLINGUA RANCH: Located between Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State Park and including much of the town of Terlingua, Terlingua Ranch is a private subdivision of over 190,000 acres, divided into 9,500 tracts owned by about 5,000 individuals and crisscrossed by 1,100 miles of dirt and rock roads. Tracts range from five acres to several hundred acres. It is some of the most rugged and scenic land in Texas. \n\nBack in the 1960’s, the Ghost Town and much of what later became “Terlingua Ranch” was owned by racing legend and car designer extraordinaire, Carol Shelby and some of his friends. The decided to promote the area by holding a chili cook-off in the then abandoned Ghost Town. That little stunt of a cook-off grew into CASI (Chili Appreciation Society International) which now hosts nearly 500 chili cook-offs around the nation and internationally, all leading up the championship cook-off every year in Terlingua. Shelby and friends later subdivided the Ranch and started selling it off to hunters and rugged naturalists. Over the decades, the area was reborn and an eclectic community of nature lovers, artists, musicians, adventurers, and folks just wanting to escape from “civilization” has grown and started to resettle this rough country. \n\nPeople have come and gone. New buildings have risen while others have fallen, Dreams have been realized and others crushed. Through it all, the land remains. The harsh desert and vast openness encourages positive development and slowly swallows up and recovers from past abuses. The old cinnabar mine sites and ranching outposts persist as relics and ghost towns, some redeveloped, some carefully preserved, and others dissolving back into the desert. Abandoned dreams eventually become points of interests for those of us that stumble upon them decades later. Terlingua Ranch is a bizarre mix of old and new, good and bad, growth and decline, all completely unregulated. Modern homes with high values and stunning designs stand beside dilapidated do-it-yourself mistakes and abandoned ruins of the 1800’s and early 1900’s. \n\nThe landscape is even more varied than the people and the structures. Rugged mountains, deep canyons, wild arroyos, dry and wet creeks, peaceful valleys, breathtaking badlands, moonscape like mud flats, the remains of ancient volcanoes, and fossilized ancient seabeds. All of it nurturing a vast array of plant life and wildlife. Around every corner and over every hill lies new and unexpected surprises. \n\nThe Ranch is now home to a few hundred hardy souls. It is also dotted with a diverse array of vacation rental lodging options and campsites. Like the diverse land, they range in quality, style, value, and price. A few are amazing dream destinations. Some are good places to sleep. Others are the stuff of nightmares. (We don’t manage any in the nightmare category.)\n\nBig Bend Vacation Rentals started out in 2007 and initially managed three of the first four vacation rentals in the Terlingua and Terlingua Ranch area. We now manage dozens out of a couple of hundred options. We represent dozens of property owners and have hosted tens of thousands of guests. You can trust us as managers, and you can rely on the properties that we manage. We have become very selective about the properties and the property owners that we add to our portfolio.InteractionWe manage several properties and live a few miles away. We are available by phone, text, email, or message. We are typically only on site for cleaning or maintenance issues.Getting AroundWe recommend high clearance and 4WD for the bumpy rock road leading to the property.

      "Crystal Mountain Cabin & Bunkhouse. Two Private Houses\n•\tTwo Modern Homes on 65 Private Acres\n•\tMain cabin sleeps four. Bunkhouse sleeps four more.\n•\tPatios and Decks with Mountain Views\n•\tFire Ring for Campfires & S'moresThe SpaceWe rent one house when your can rent two? Crystal Mountain Cabin was custom built in 2019. The neighboring bunkhouse was extensively remodeled that same year. Relax inside or outside and enjoy the mountain views. Built to accommodate four guests in comfort and style.\n\nRent one home or two. The listing is for BOTH homes. If your group is four people or fewer, consider booking Crystal Mountain Cabin, that listing is for just the main cabin and rents for significantly less than renting both. Either way, you will have exclusive access to 65 acres.\n\nCrystal Mountain Cabin and Bunkhouse on Terlingua Ranch provide your group the ideal base for your visit to the Big Bend Region. Modern design will set the perfect tone for your Big Bend adventure.  The surprising seclusion will provide ample privacy and solitude.\n \nRelax inside or outside. Lots of space, large windows, covered decks, a large stone patio, and 65 private acres provide lots of options on where to hang out. \n\nAt night watch meteors fall and satellites fly overhead as you marvel at the Milky Way. Relax around the campfire with a refreshing beverage, maybe even a sausage on a stick, or better yet, some s’mores. Whatever you eat and drink around the fire ring, will go well with campfire stories, some songs, or whatever else you want to do. It’s just you and your partner, or family and friends, under a starry Texas sky.\n\nDuring the day, head into to park, down to Terlingua, or to the Rio Grande, or just enjoy the home and the secluded 65 acres of Chihuahuan Desert habitat. At the property, relax inside or outside or go for a hike around the rugged and scenic property. Wildlife and diverse desert plant life and abundant and varied.\n\nMAIN CABIN:\nThe living room and kitchen are open concept with lots of space and amazing views through large picture windows. The kitchen is fully stocked with dishes, cookware, utensils, a large fridge, glass top stove and oven, dishwasher, and all the basics you would expect in a large kitchen. The bedrooms have king bed in the master and a queen bed in the second bedroom. The bathroom is spacious and stylish with two sinks and a large shower.\n\nBUNKHOUSE:\nThe bunkhouse has three small bedrooms. One has a queen bed and the other\ntwo each have a twin bed. There is also a full bath with a shower/tub combo, toilet, and two sinks. There is small kitchen and living room, plus private front and rear decks. \n\nTerlingua Ranch Lodge, just ten minutes away has the Bad Rabbit Café; for great food, cold drinks, and frequent live music. The lodge office is also the place to register if you want to explore the Christmas Mountain conservation area. Terlingua and the western entrance to Big Bend National Park is a short 35-minute drive away. Adventure outfitters located in Terlingua offer river trips, horseback riding, jeep tours, ATV adventures, Jeep rentals, guided hikes, and mountain bike rentals. The famous Terlingua Ghost Town is just 40 minutes away. Both the Ghost Town and the Terlingua/Study Butte area offer shopping, dining, drinking, live music, art galleries, and more. Heading another 15 minutes west from Terlingua will take you to Lajitas for more upscale dining options, a few great shops, and the chance to meet Clay Henry, the beer drinking goat that happens to be the mayor. Big Bend Ranch State Park (the national park’s wild and rugged cousin) is right there as well. Stop in at the Barton Warnock center just before you get to Lajitas for an overview of the park, museum, and a terrific book shop. Alpine, Fort Davis, Marfa, and the McDonald Observatory are also within easy day trip range.\n \nCome on down. Enjoy the Big Bend. Do as much or as little as you like. You’ll have a memorable time and will likely start planning your return trip before you even leave. That’s great. We’ll love to have come back over and over. In fact, that’s how the owner of Crystal Mountain became the owner. He came out here so often and enjoyed staying at other Big Bend Vacation Rental properties so much that he eventually decided to acquire his own properties. He now owns Crystal Mountain One and Two and Crystal Valley, just a short drive away. He was very deliberate and considerate in incorporating all the things he enjoyed the most at other rentals, plus adding extra touches to create the ultimate Big Bend vacation home base. Now, he’s eager to share it all with you.Guest AccessBoth houses and 65 private acres are exclusively yours.InteractionWe manage several properties and live a few miles away.

      "Lajitas House offers comfort and convenience with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Located in the historic Lajitas Resort, just 30 minutes from Big Bend National Park, 20 minutes from the Terlingua Ghost Town, one mile from Big Bend Ranch State Park, and a short walk to the Lajitas boardwalk. Relax in the shade of our front porch. Prepare your meals in our fully equipped kitchen. Visit with family or friends in our beautifully decorated living room. Retire for the night in our comfortable bedrooms.The SpaceLajitas House is in the historic Lajitas Resort area just 30 minutes from the beauty of the Big Bend National Park and 1 mile from the Big Bend Ranch State Park. Both parks have a variety of hikes and some truly spectacular scenery. Be sure to visit the local Barton Warnock Environmental Education Center on the east side of Lajitas for information and interesting exhibits.\n\nAfterwards, relax in the shade of our front porch, enjoy the pristine view out across the shimmering Rio Grande River into the majestic mountains of Mexico or walk down the hill and sit by the river. Enjoy the peacefulness that underlies the Lajitas experience.\n\nLajitas House is within walking distance to the Lajitas boardwalk which offers shopping and a full service spa. Walk to the historic Lajitas Trading Post, which includes a deli, or to the Candellia, an excellent restaurant on the boardwalk where you can enjoy a meal in rustic elegance outdoors or in. The Thirsty Goat Bar offers a variety of libations in a comfortable and richly decorated environment.\n\nLajitas House is ideally located for easy access to resort facilities in Lajitas (except the private pool). However, please note that at particularly busy times, the resort may occasionally limit access to the golf course, dining options, or other resort amenities. We recommend that guests check with Lajitas Resort to verify access to any resort amenities they may plan to utilize, including world-class golfing at Black Jack's Crossing, the Agave Spa, and the Equestrian Center.\n\nA twenty minutes drive east and you are in the historic Terlingua Ghost Town. The world famous Chili Cook-off Championship occurs annually early in November. In Terlingua you can enjoy dining at The Starlight Theatre Restaurant and Bar and shopping at the Trading Post.\n\nA short drive west from Lajitas House on the spectacular River Road (Texas 170) takes you through the magnificent vistas of Big Bend Ranch State Park and past historic Fort Leaton to the official border crossing at Presidio. On the Mexican side is the city of Ojinaga, site of the historic Battle of Ojinaga between the rebel soldiers of Pancho Villa and Mexican Federales.\n\nRecently the crossing into Boquillas, a small Mexican border town on the Rio Grande Mexico became a reality. If you choose to make this adventure part of your Big Bend experience, you must have a passport. Boquillos is on the east side of Big Bend National Park. Remember: You must have an unexpired passport.NeighborhoodLajitas House is ideally located for easy access to resort facilities in Lajitas (except the private pool).
